      "text": "**Defining System Scope**\n\nI'm currently focused on defining the initial scope for this Padel Tennis TMS, primarily based on the provided BRD. I've broken down the key user roles (Admin, Referee, Team, Spectator) to ensure comprehensive feature coverage. The challenge is balancing the richness of features with the development timeline.\n\n\n**Refining Technical Choices**\n\nI've decided to streamline the backend for the MVP by using local storage or in-memory state, effectively simulating a real backend to maintain focus on the core React application development. I'm prioritizing the implementation of key features such as tournament creation, team registration, and the referee interface. I'm planning to create a visual representation for the tournament winner. I'm still weighing the best approach for bracket generation and real-time scoring.\n\n\n**Choosing UI Components**\n\nI've selected `lucide-react` for icons and I'll likely use `recharts` for visualization, potentially for stats. Banner generation will initially use a simple HTML/CSS preview, as the `html-to-image` approach is tricky to integrate without a CDN, though I'm thinking of `html2canvas` for download. I'll maintain a top-level context for all state management, simulating a backend.\n\n\n**Detailing Key Components**\n\nI'm now diving into the component breakdown and thinking about the flow. I'm focusing on the main components, their interactions, and the data they'll handle. I'm structuring the `AdminDashboard` for tournament creation and team approvals. I will be developing the public `Registration` component. The bracket will be visualized with `BracketView`. For the referee, I'm defining a `RefereeDashboard` and a `LiveScoring` component for handling the scoring, and a `BannerGenerator` for winner announcements.\n\n\n**Defining Public/Referee Flows**\n\nI'm now detailing the public and referee workflows. I'm focusing on the \"Generate Schedule\" button functionality, alongside registration and match views. For the referee, I'm outlining login, scoring (with point/game/set logic), and match completion features. I'm building a simple banner component using match data to render the winner card. I'll focus on UI components next.\n\n\n**Implementing Core Components**\n\nNow I'm focusing on key component implementations. I've got `Card.tsx`, an `AdminPanel`, `SpectatorView`, `Registration`, `RefereeDashboard`, and `LiveScoring` set up, alongside `App.tsx`, `index.tsx`, and `index.html`. My current focus is implementing the robust helper function for the scoring logic. I'm thinking about how to handle the `currentSetIndex`, `sets`, and `currentGame` states, with a focus on a clean Tiebreaker implementation. I'm also preparing for the visual \"Schedule\" representation, probably as a simplified list view. I'm making sure my UI is slick, and considering `framer-motion` for transitions.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Core Implementation**\n\nI've decided against `framer-motion` due to potential environmental constraints; Tailwind's transition classes offer a dependency-free alternative. I'm focusing on the \"Live Scoring\" component as the central interactive piece. I've also verified `recharts` is suitable for stats, but might be overkill for the bracket. The key files are now in place, from `metadata.json` to `index.tsx`. I will be consolidating the views into fewer files if I can. I have a clear color palette ready.\n\n\n",

      "text": "**Completing Missing Files**\n\nI'm focused on finishing the `AdminDashboard.tsx` file and any others that were potentially cut off. The goal is a clean, complete code output for your expert review. I am ensuring that the files were not truncated, and will include any other incomplete code snippets.\n\n\n**Addressing File Omissions**\n\nI've determined that `index.tsx` is completely absent and requires creation, and `AdminDashboard.tsx` is truncated. My focus now is on completing these files to reflect the BRD from the previous interaction. I'm prioritizing filling in the missing content based on the application's overall requirements and structure as defined in that BRD. I will attempt to fill in the AdminDashboard gaps.\n\n\n**Defining Component Scope**\n\nI'm now outlining each required component's functionality, focusing on how they will fulfill the BRD's requirements. I will define the role of `App.tsx` for routing. I will start the implementation phase, starting with the `index.tsx`, `components/AdminDashboard.tsx`, and `components/RegistrationForm.tsx` components.\n\n\n**Clarifying Routing and Components**\n\nI'm now clarifying the routing strategy to structure the `App.tsx` file to manage the active tab state and conditionally render components such as `AdminDashboard`, `RegistrationForm`, and the others. I'm focusing on defining the responsibilities of each component and how they interact, with a solid component list.\n\n\n**Implementing Scoreboard Components**\n\nI'm now detailing the `LiveScoreboard` component, focusing on displaying live match scores with controls like \"Start Match\" and \"End Match.\" I'm also planning the `WinnerBanner` component for displaying match results, and I intend to implement it so users can capture a \"screenshot\" of the visual banner component. For the visual design, I will leverage the dark theme Tailwind colors to ensure the UI is consistent.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Core Components**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the architecture of the components. The new components `RegistrationForm.tsx`, `RefereeInterface.tsx`, `LiveScoreboard.tsx` and `WinnerBanner.tsx` are critical. I am updating `AdminDashboard.tsx`, filling out form fields and implementing a dashboard view for schedule generation, along with the other required components. I am prioritizing a minimal viable product with functional and complete components. My focus is on ensuring a clean code base.\n\n\n**Refining Component Structure**\n\nI've decided to embed `WinnerBanner` inside `RefereeInterface` for simplicity, though I'll keep it a discrete component for cleanliness. Regarding data changes from storage, I'll need to account for localStorage updates and plan for either component re-renders through parent state, or polling for MVP. For now, `LiveScoreboard` will poll, `AdminDashboard` will refresh on actions, and `RefereeInterface` will update local state, then push to storage. I am now beginning code implementation with `index.tsx`.\n\n\n",

      "text": "**Addressing Type Errors**\n\nI'm currently focused on rectifying type mismatches. Specifically, line 56 in `services/storage.ts` throws an error; it appears `\"PENDING\"` isn't compatible with `RegistrationStatus`. I need to review that enum definition and figure out how to resolve this assignment issue. I will focus on this first before moving on to other errors.\n\n\n**Resolving Type Mismatches**\n\nI've made headway on the type errors. In `services/storage.ts`, I've verified `RegistrationStatus` is imported. Now, I need to replace the string literals with enum members. Also, I'll tackle the `RefereeInterface.tsx` errors next. I'll be importing `X` and `Trophy` from `lucide-react` to resolve the \"cannot find name\" errors in `components/RefereeInterface.tsx`. I believe this will fix the issue.\n\n\n**Importing RegistrationStatus**\n\nI now recognize the absence of `RegistrationStatus` in `services/storage.ts` imports. I see the error stemming from not importing `RegistrationStatus`, but I've updated the file to include this import now. The string literals in the file are being updated to use corresponding enum members. I am making good progress. I will then update the `RefereeInterface.tsx` imports.\n\n\n**Refining Team Status Logic**\n\nI've just refined the team status logic. I've updated the `newTeam` object to now assign `RegistrationStatus.PENDING`. Also, in the `updateTeamStatus` function, I have updated the type to `RegistrationStatus`. I am examining the potential for casting in the `AdminDashboard` component to integrate with the enum for increased type safety. I think this will resolve the typing issues. I'll need to update the caller of the function.\n\n\n**Updating Function Signature**\n\nI am now focusing on the `AdminDashboard` component and its interaction with the `storage.ts` module. I am updating the `handleTeamAction` function signature in `storage.ts` to accept `RegistrationStatus` instead of raw strings to ensure type safety. I am evaluating how to best handle the incoming string literals ('ACCEPTED', 'REJECTED') from the dashboard to ensure compatibility. I might need to cast or convert the strings within `AdminDashboard` before passing them to the function to maintain type integrity. I will ensure the overall flow of type information is sound.\n\n\n**Implementing `registerTeam`**\n\nI've updated the `registerTeam` function in `services/storage.ts` to integrate the refined type definitions. The function now correctly assigns `RegistrationStatus.PENDING` to the new team. I also updated the `updateTeamStatus` function's implementation to align with the new type safety features. This ensures consistency and reduces potential errors. The flow looks good, I'll keep testing and refining.\n\n\n**Adjusting Enum Comparisons**\n\nI am now focusing on aligning the team status comparisons with the `RegistrationStatus` enum. I am updating the `generateSchedule` function to use `RegistrationStatus.ACCEPTED` directly in the filter to ensure type safety and consistency. I also need to ensure that the `updateTeamStatus` function in `AdminDashboard.tsx` is updated to correctly pass the `RegistrationStatus` enum values.\n\n\n**Refactoring Status Types**\n\nI'm now refactoring the `updateTeamStatus` signature to require `RegistrationStatus`. I am now passing the enum directly, and I am casting any string literals passed to the function to ensure type safety. I am examining whether changing the argument type to `RegistrationStatus` will resolve compatibility issues with string-based status values. I am evaluating how to best handle the incoming string literals to ensure compatibility.\n\n\n**Updating Imports in AdminDashboard**\n\nI've confirmed `AdminDashboard.tsx` now correctly imports `RegistrationStatus` on line 2. The function `handleTeamAction` currently takes a string literal, but I am re-evaluating the signature of `updateTeamStatus` in `storage.ts` to expect `RegistrationStatus` directly. I am now evaluating the best approach to handle the string literals that are being passed in the current implementation, and trying to fix the error inside of `storage.ts`.\n\n**Importing lucide-react in RefereeInterface.tsx**\n\nI need to fix the imports in `components/RefereeInterface.tsx`. I can see on line 242 and 246, I need to import `X` and `Trophy` from `'lucide-react'` in order to fix the errors.\n\n\n**Verifying Changes to Storage**\n\nI've just finished verifying the `services/storage.ts` changes. I can confirm `registerTeam` uses `RegistrationStatus.PENDING`, and `updateTeamStatus` now takes `RegistrationStatus` as a parameter. I also confirmed that `generateSchedule` should now directly use `RegistrationStatus.ACCEPTED` for better consistency and type safety. I'm satisfied with these changes. I'll test.\n\n\n**Evaluating Type Compatibility**\n\nI am now assessing the compatibility between `AdminDashboard.tsx` and the updated `updateTeamStatus` function in `storage.ts`. Specifically, I'm checking if the existing string literals ('ACCEPTED', 'REJECTED') passed to `handleTeamAction` are compatible with `RegistrationStatus`. I am deciding if I should change `updateTeamStatus` to the signature `status: RegistrationStatus | 'ACCEPTED' | 'REJECTED'`, though it will cause `team.status = status;` to throw an error, since `status` is not of the correct type.\n\n\n",

      "text": "**Considering Sidebar Interaction**\n\nI'm focusing on making the sidebar interaction more engaging. The plan is to reveal icon titles on hover. Currently, the `Layout.tsx` file handles the sidebar's responsive behavior, shrinking to a 20-unit width on mobile. Now, I will need to extend this to react to hover events and display the titles accordingly.\n\n\n**Analyzing Layout and Hover**\n\nI'm now investigating the sidebar layout's conditional behavior. It appears the sidebar uses `flex md:flex-col`, indicating a switch to a column layout on medium screens. On larger desktops (`lg:w-64`), the labels are visible (`hidden lg:block`). My focus is on the medium state – specifically, how to incorporate hover effects to display labels or tooltips when collapsed. I'll need to adjust the existing `Layout.tsx` to handle these hover events.\n\n\n**Refining Hover Logic**\n\nMy focus is shifting to refining the hover interaction. I've pinpointed the relevant styling within the button's `className`. My plan is to expand the sidebar width on hover, using `w-full md:w-20 lg:w-64 hover:md:w-64`. Now, I'm working to reveal the text, changing `hidden lg:block` to `hidden lg:block group-hover:block` (with the addition of `group` to the `<nav>`). I'm aiming to refine the logic so that the titles display correctly on hover, particularly on medium screens (md) where the sidebar is initially collapsed to a width of `w-20`.\n\n\n**Implementing Hover Effect**\n\nI've made progress on the sidebar hover effect implementation. I've updated the `<nav>` element's `className` with `group transition-[width] duration-300 ease-in-out` and adjusted width logic. I've transitioned to `md:w-20 md:hover:w-64 lg:w-64` to handle the responsive behavior and introduced `hidden md:group-hover:block` for the text visibility.\n\n\n**Adjusting Navbar Visibility**\n\nI'm now refining the `NavItem` text visibility. I've updated it to `hidden md:group-hover:block lg:block` to match the `nav`'s `group` class. I also realized that I need to adjust the justification of the `NavItem` button based on the sidebar width. The default is `justify-center`, and `md:justify-start` is only needed when expanded, so I am going to make some adjustments to the current code.\n\n\n**Aligning NavItem Content**\n\nI'm now focusing on fine-tuning the `NavItem` alignment within the sidebar. I've confirmed that if I'm using `md:justify-start`, the items will be left-aligned on hover. I'm taking another look at how to ensure this is handled efficiently when the sidebar width changes, ensuring the layout remains consistent and visually appealing on both medium and large screens, as well as upon hover.\n\n\n**Implementing Item Alignment**\n\nI'm now focusing on the `NavItem` alignment within the sidebar, especially with how the titles are presented on hover. I'm exploring using `group-hover` for the width and text visibility, and I think it's the right direction. I'll need to update the `NavItem` to `w-full md:justify-center md:group-hover:justify-start justify-center` for optimal alignment. I also want to prevent text wrapping with `whitespace-nowrap`. I'm working with the `Layout.tsx` file for the necessary adjustments.\n\n\n**Finalizing Sidebar Implementation**\n\nI'm now in the final stages, aiming for a fully functional sidebar. I've focused on aligning the `NavItem` content with `w-full md:justify-center md:group-hover:justify-start justify-center`, and `whitespace-nowrap`. I made sure the layout remains visually consistent on all screen sizes, including the hover effects. I am also making sure there are no text wrapping issues. I believe I have completed the adjustments to the current code.\n\n\n**Refining Text Wrapping**\n\nI'm now focusing on refining the text wrapping within the sidebar, and I have addressed potential text wrapping issues. I've successfully reviewed the adjusted code within `Layout.tsx`, and verified that the items are neatly aligned, with no unexpected wrapping. I am ready to move on.\n\n\n**Analyzing Alignment Adjustments**\n\nI've realized the existing `md:justify-start` in `NavItem` causes unexpected left alignment on medium screens, even when collapsed. Analyzing the dimensions, I'm calculating the necessary space for the icon, padding, and gap to refine the alignment. The target is now centered when collapsed, and left-aligned on hover. I'm focusing on the `Layout.tsx` and evaluating the existing code, adjusting `md:justify-start` based on this analysis.\n\n\n**Revising Item Alignment**\n\nI'm now revising the item alignment for the sidebar navigation. My goal is to ensure the items are centered when collapsed on medium screens, and left-aligned upon hover. I've re-examined the initial implementation, specifically the `md:justify-start` class, and its impact on the layout. Now, I will implement `md:justify-center md:group-hover:justify-start` for optimal visual balance, centering the items when the sidebar is collapsed on medium screens, but left-aligning them on hover, as needed.\n\n\n**Evaluating Mobile Interaction**\n\nI'm now evaluating the sidebar's mobile interaction and adjusting for the horizontal scrolling behavior. My primary focus is to ensure the buttons correctly utilize `flex-none` or `w-auto`. I'm going to update the `NavItem` component to be `flex-none` so the navigation can be horizontally scrollable. I will also assess whether the existing `w-full` on `NavItem` causes problems in the mobile horizontal scroll layout. I'm taking a close look at the existing setup to preserve the current mobile behavior.\n\n\n\n**Clarifying Screen Behavior**\n\nI'm now clarifying the intended screen behavior for the sidebar, specifically on larger screens. I'm debating whether to keep the large screen behavior expanded by default (as it currently is), or if the user wants it to be collapsed on hover, similar to the medium screens. I'm considering all screen sizes and their respective hover states.\n\n\n**Implementing Hover States**\n\nI'm now implementing the hover states for medium-sized screens to expand and display titles. The sidebar will maintain its expanded state on larger screens. I've adjusted the code to expand the sidebar width on hover, revealing the titles. I've also incorporated `overflow-hidden` to prevent text overlap during transitions. I'm focusing on ensuring responsiveness. I'm reviewing the current setup to ensure the user is getting the best interaction.\n\n\n**Reviewing Screen Logic**\n\nI'm now revisiting the logic for screen size behavior. My focus is on ensuring the medium and large screens correctly display the sidebar states. I've confirmed that the expanded behavior on large screens is still maintained. The medium-sized screens continue to expand and reveal titles on hover, as intended. I'm now testing the code.\n\n\n**Refining Title Display**\n\nI'm now refining how the titles display with a closer look at `md:justify-start`. I'm going to switch to `md:justify-center` for the default medium state, and then activate `md:group-hover:justify-start` on hover. The `gap-3` will separate the icon and label, as planned. I'm focusing on the `Layout.tsx` for these changes, ensuring a balanced look.\n\n\n**Adjusting Icon Spacing**\n\nI'm now revising the sidebar item spacing and alignment, specifically addressing the icon and text positioning. I have identified where to switch to `md:justify-center` for the default medium state, and then the need for `md:group-hover:justify-start` on hover. I'm taking a close look at the existing `gap-3` between the icon and label. I'm focusing on the `Layout.tsx` for these changes, ensuring optimal spacing and alignment.\n\n\n**Refining Tab Content**\n\nI'm now integrating the provided tab content into the sidebar. I will update the `NavItem` components, incorporating the new labels (\"Live\", \"Register\", \"Referee\", \"Admin\") along with their respective icons, `onClick` handlers, and `active` states. I am confirming proper alignment within the new sidebar layout to ensure a seamless integration.\n\n\n",

      "text": "**Refining Player Scoring**\n\nI'm currently focused on the need to track individual player points within a team, which impacts the `ScoreState` and `Match` data structures. My challenge is to accurately record which player scored a point in sports like Padel or Tennis, where scoring is typically team-based.\n\n\n**Implementing Player Selection**\n\nI've realized the core issue is selecting the scoring player in sports. My plan involves a data model update to record individual player contributions. I'll modify the `ScoreEngine` to use player identifiers and update the `RefereeInterface` to select the scoring player. Specifically, I'm refactoring the UI to have four buttons for selecting the point winner, one for each player.\n\n\n**Defining Point History Format**\n\nI'm now focusing on how to represent point history within the `ScoreState`. I'm considering using a string format like \"T1P1\" or \"T2P2\" to represent which team and player scored. This history will be stored on the backend, as per requirements. I'm leaning toward defining a structured `Point` type in `types.ts` for clarity, or just using the convention.\n\n\n**Recording Player Detail**\n\nI'm making progress on capturing individual player details within the scoring system. I've updated the `addPoint` function to accept both `teamId` and `playerId`. This will allow storing the point history correctly. I'm focusing on updating the `history` array in `ScoreState` to track these specific player events, likely using a 'T1P1' format for each point. Also, I realized that the `ScoreState` interface's `history: string[]` is sufficient after all, if the points are recorded as strings.\n\n\n**Updating UI Controls**\n\nI'm now focused on the UI, specifically the referee interface. I plan to change the display for point selection to show individual player buttons for each team. The current two-column layout will become nested grids, allowing clear selection for each player. My goal is to add buttons, labeled with player names, that when pressed will record the specific player who scored the point.\n\n\n**Adjusting Point Tracking**\n\nI'm now revising the `handlePoint` function signature to accept both team and player index. I'm focusing on `services/scoreEngine.ts`. The `addPoint` function will change to accept `team` and `playerIdx`. The `ScoreState`'s history will be updated to append an object or string representing the player's contribution, such as `\"T1P1\"`. I'll push strings to meet backend storage requirements, and am leaning towards JSON or \"T1P1\".\n\n\n**Finalizing Point Logging**\n\nI'm now implementing the final changes in `services/scoreEngine.ts` and `components/RefereeInterface.tsx`. I've added the `playerIdx` argument to the `addPoint` function and renamed the `player` argument to `team` to avoid confusion. I'm also pushing the team and player data in a timestamped string to the `history` array, in the format `T${team}P${playerIdx}:${Date.now()}`. I'm updating the UI in the referee interface by adding four smaller buttons, one for each player, and updating the `handlePoint` call to include the `playerIdx`. I've verified that the `ScoreState` history is correctly storing the point data as strings.\n\n\n**Revising UI Buttons**\n\nI'm now revising the UI. The current huge buttons need splitting, and I'm designing a clearer four-button grid. The new layout will have two columns, one for each team. Each team column will contain two buttons, one for each player, labeled with their names. This is much clearer. I'll also confirm the back-end does not leak private details to the front-end, as the `LiveScoreboard` doesn't show history. I am proceeding by updating both `services/scoreEngine.ts` and `components/RefereeInterface.tsx`. I am focusing on using `team` and `playerIdx`.\n\n\n**Updating Point History**\n\nI'm now focusing on ensuring point history includes `playerIdx`, and have updated `addPoint` in `services/scoreEngine.ts`. I am now storing `history` as strings formatted like `T${team}P${playerIdx}`. This new format is stored when the buttons are pressed in the UI, and should integrate with backend requirements. I am also updating the `handlePoint` function in the UI.\n\n\n**Refining Button Handling**\n\nI'm now revising the UI button handlers for clarity and accuracy. I've updated the `handlePoint` function in `RefereeInterface.tsx` to handle team and player indices. I'm focusing on ensuring the new button clicks correctly update the `history` array in `ScoreState` with the proper team and player data, ensuring data integrity. Specifically, I'm refactoring the UI to have four buttons in a two-column layout.\n\n\n**Improving Button Logic**\n\nI'm now focusing on refining the button click handlers in `RefereeInterface.tsx`. I've updated the button layout and am verifying the new team and player indices are correctly updated in the state history. This will ensure that the UI clicks integrate precisely with the backend storage logic and preserve data integrity, as per previous designs.\n\n\n**Verifying Scoring Logic**\n\nI'm now checking `services/scoreEngine.ts` to confirm scoring logic and data flow. The UI updates are in, with four specific player buttons, now. I am verifying data integrity and checking that the current `handlePoint` implementation correctly passes the `team` and `playerIdx` data to `addPoint`.\n\n\n",

      "text": "**Rebranding the Application**\n\nI'm currently focused on the application's rebranding. I've received the new logo's HTML/CSS and am ready to implement the changes. My primary task is updating `metadata.json` with the new application name \"Match Up\" and its associated description. Next, I'll update `index.html` and other assets as needed.\n\n\n**Implementing the UI Changes**\n\nI'm now implementing the UI changes. I've focused on `components/ui/Layout.tsx`, where I'm replacing the old logo and text with the new \"Match Up\" logo structure. I'm translating the given HTML/CSS, taking into account the existing component structure and updating the scoreboard's title text. Next, I will replace the title tag in the `index.html` file.\n\n\n**Adapting the New Logo**\n\nI'm now focusing on adapting the new logo into `Layout.tsx`, which uses Tailwind. I'm considering scaling down the logo from 80px to fit the sidebar constraints (perhaps `h-10 w-10`), since the sidebar collapses and has a limited width, even though the original CSS provided is for 80px by 80px. I'm also considering the colors and their use within the overall app theme, aiming to balance aesthetic consistency with the provided design. I will assess whether I will update the logo color to match the app's established theme.\n\n\n**Refining the Logo Integration**\n\nI'm now refining the logo integration, specifically in `Layout.tsx`. I've determined that `w-20` is indeed 80px, and I've scaled it down, settling on `h-10 w-10` (40px) or `h-12 w-12` (48px) for better fit in the sidebar. The background will be white, with a 3x3 grid of navy dots. I've updated the component's structure in `Layout.tsx` as well. I'm also considering the implications of the original CSS's `gap` and `padding` values and their scaling, aiming for approximately half those values. Finally, I will check and update \"PadelPro TMS\" string in the `LiveScoreboard.tsx` file.\n\n\n**Updating the Strings**\n\nI'm now changing strings across the application. I've updated the application name and title in `index.html`. In `Layout.tsx`, I've replaced the trophy icon with the \"Match Up\" logo and updated the text accordingly, and I'm updating the `LiveScoreboard.tsx` file too. I am going to make sure to update \"Join\" in the registration form to correctly reflect the tournament name as well, and I will update the placeholder text and database key.\n\n\n**Implementing the CSS**\n\nI'm now implementing the CSS. I will directly translate the provided CSS for the logo icon into the JSX for `Layout.tsx`. Considering the sidebar's width in collapsed mode, I'm scaling down the logo to a suitable size; I'm settling on `h-10 w-10` or `h-12 w-12`. I'll focus on inlining the `grid` and `gap` properties as well. I'm focusing on the white background and navy dots.\n\n\n**Refining the Animation**\n\nI'm now refining the animation. For the logo, using `animate-pulse` looks acceptable, but the user provided custom keyframes, which I'd prefer to use. I can add the keyframes to `index.html` for global styles or inline, but global seems cleanest.\n\n\n**Defining the Animation**\n\nI'm now defining the animation and its implementation. I've decided to update `index.html` to include the `logoPulse` keyframes within the `<style>` block for global application use. I'm focusing on the `Layout.tsx` update, where I'll apply the logo markup. I will focus on deciding where I would define the logo's styles, considering Tailwind arbitrary values and the convenience of injecting directly into `Layout.tsx`.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Content**\n\nI am finalizing the content and preparing the XML. I've updated \"PadelPro TMS\" to \"Match Up\" in `LiveScoreboard.tsx` and updated the relevant strings. I've also identified a slight color difference between the sidebar and the navy dot color and confirmed this contrast is sufficient. Finally, I'm generating an XML change log for the updates.\n\n\n\n**Implementing the Animation**\n\nI'm now integrating the animation in `Layout.tsx`. The logo's animation is now rendered using the `<style>` tag. I'm injecting the delay using the `style` attribute. The `gap` and `padding` values from the original CSS have been adjusted and now match the sidebar's proportions. I've used `className` and styled the span element using inline styles for `animation` and `animationDelay`.\n\n\n**Adjusting the UI**\n\nI'm now making final adjustments to the UI, particularly the sidebar content. I've updated the \"PadelPro\" text to \"Match Up\" in the `Layout.tsx` component, keeping in mind the original CSS's font stack for text: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif, to ensure consistency with the new logo. I'll test to confirm it's faithful to the desired design. I'm also ensuring the scaling of padding and gap are correct.\n\n\n**Testing the Integration**\n\nI'm now testing the integration. I've successfully applied the `index.html` changes and am focused on `Layout.tsx` adjustments. I'm using the `style` property with the `animation` and `animationDelay` properties on the span element to trigger the logo pulse animation.\n\n\n**Verifying the Structure**\n\nI'm now verifying the structure. I've re-reviewed the `Layout.tsx` component, ensuring the logo implementation aligns with the given HTML/CSS, and I've verified the `h-12 w-12` dimensions for the logo. The inline styles for animation and `animationDelay` are correct. I'm satisfied with the integration.\n\n\n",

      "text": "**Implementing Admin Login**\n\nI'm working on adding a login mechanism to the Admin Dashboard. Right now, it's directly accessible through the `App.tsx` navigation using a tab feature. I'm focusing on securing access by implementing an authentication layer. I will use the testing email, `zayam@test.com`, to develop the login process first.\n\n\n**Adding Authentication Layer**\n\nI've begun modifying `AdminDashboard.tsx` to handle the authentication state. I've added state variables for authentication, email, and password. My current approach involves displaying a login form if the user isn't authenticated, and, if the provided credentials are valid, the dashboard renders. I'm focusing on validating the hardcoded email 'zayam@test.com' and the password 'Test123!@#'.\n\n\n**Refining the Implementation Plan**\n\nI've updated `AdminDashboard.tsx`, adding the `Lock` icon import for UI consistency. I've also established the state variables for authentication, email, and password. My current plan involves a `handleLogin` function to manage authentication. I will wrap the existing dashboard content within an `isAuthenticated` check, and display a login card if unauthenticated, similar to the Referee interface, but with email/password fields.\n\n\n**Consolidating Dashboard Views**\n\nI've integrated the existing dashboard's dual view logic (Create Tournament/Tournament Dashboard) within the authenticated block to maintain functionality. The `isAuthenticated` check will now determine visibility of either the \"Create Tournament\" or \"Tournament Dashboard\", keeping the existing logic intact. This approach consolidates the dashboard views based on authentication status. I also added a `Lock` icon to the login form.\n\n\n**Finalizing Login Form**\n\nI've crafted the Admin login form within `AdminDashboard.tsx`, including email and password fields, using state variables to capture input. The UI is implemented using a custom style, and it matches the form fields of the Referee interface. I am now preparing to connect the form's `onSubmit` event to the authentication logic.\n\n\n**Refactoring View Logic**\n\nI'm now integrating the existing \"Create Tournament\" and \"Tournament Dashboard\" logic within the `isAuthenticated` check, ensuring I don't disrupt the component's functionality. I'll maintain the current dual-view logic; it will remain intact based on the authentication state. The login form will now precede either of the existing views. I'm importing `Lock` icon from `lucide-react` to be consistent with the design. I will use the email the user requested.\n\n\n**Adjusting Initial Authentication**\n\nI've realized the `AdminDashboard` component mounts after a tab selection in `App.tsx`. Therefore, the `isAuthenticated` state will initialize as `false`, and the login form will display correctly. This simplifies the need for additional logic to manage initial state. I'll focus on ensuring the form correctly updates the authentication state upon successful login.\n\n\n**Implementing XML Update**\n\nI've added the XML update to `AdminDashboard.tsx`, including authentication logic with hardcoded credentials. It also includes imports such as Check, X, Calendar, Users, Trophy, PlayCircle, and Lock. I am currently focusing on ensuring the login function correctly updates authentication state and that the form UI is consistent.\n\n\n**Connecting Login Logic**\n\nI've wired up the login form's `onSubmit` to the `handleLogin` function. Right now, it checks hardcoded credentials to update the authentication state. If they match the hardcoded values, `setIsAuthenticated` flips to true. Otherwise, an alert pops up. I am focusing now on getting this to work as expected.\n\n\n**Adding Tournament Logic**\n\nI've integrated tournament management functions into the authenticated area. I have added logic to `AdminDashboard.tsx` to handle actions on tournaments. I'm focusing on the `handleCreateTournament`, `handleUpdateTournament`, `handleTeamAction`, and `handleGenerateSchedule` functions, ensuring they interact with the backend to update and manage tournament data. I'm also ensuring the page updates the user after actions are taken.\n\n\n**Refining Credential Checks**\n\nI've updated the credential check within `handleLogin`, implementing email and password fields. Right now, it validates hardcoded credentials against those entered in the form. The UI design follows that of the Referee interface. I am currently focusing on streamlining these checks to improve robustness, using my current email.\n\n\n**Styling the Login Form**\n\nI've restyled the login form in `AdminDashboard.tsx`, matching the Referee interface's look. I focused on the input fields and the button. The input fields now have a custom style, matching the Referee interface, with appropriate styling to match this interface's design. The button follows a consistent design too. I am currently working on styling the form for improved visual cohesion.\n\n\n\n**Integrating Tournament Logic**\n\nI've begun integrating tournament logic into the dashboard, specifically within the authenticated area. I have now introduced state variables for tournament data and created functions to handle actions on tournaments, such as creating, updating, managing teams and generating schedules. I am currently concentrating on the backend integration and ensuring that these functions appropriately interact with the existing backend to accurately manage tournament data and page updates.\n\n\n**Adding Tournament Fields**\n\nI've integrated new fields for tournament creation within `AdminDashboard.tsx`, including `TournamentFormat`, `SkillLevel`, and `MaxTeams`. I'm focusing on ensuring these fields are correctly populated and submitted alongside other tournament data when the form submits. I've also incorporated error handling to provide appropriate feedback to the user on submission, to ensure a user-friendly experience.\n\n\n**Expanding Tournament Fields**\n\nI've added the new tournament fields, `refereePasscode` and `courts`, to `AdminDashboard.tsx`. I'm now integrating these within the existing tournament creation form, focusing on ensuring they're properly captured with the appropriate input types and handling the comma-separated court entries correctly. I also am adding the appropriate styles so they are consistent with the other fields.\n\n\n**Adding Tournament Fields**\n\nI've added the new tournament fields, including the input for comma-separated courts within `AdminDashboard.tsx`. I am focusing now on parsing and formatting the input for `courts` from a comma-separated string to an array, ensuring the form submits the data correctly. I'm also ensuring the styling is consistent with the other input fields.\n\n\n**Refining UI Display**\n\nI'm now incorporating logic for the tournament dashboard display. I've added dynamic display features like team counts, tournament format information, and the referee passcode. I'm focusing on conditional rendering for the generate bracket button, ensuring it only appears if there are no existing matches, and at least two teams are accepted. I'm making sure it displays consistently.\n\n\n\n**Updating Tournament UI**\n\nI've integrated the pending requests display in `AdminDashboard.tsx`. I am now focusing on displaying a list of teams that have registered and displaying controls to accept or reject these teams. I'm focusing on the implementation of these actions and ensuring the display updates the user in real time.\n\n\n\n**Implementing Team Handling**\n\nI'm now implementing the team handling logic. I've focused on integrating team acceptance and rejection within the dashboard, displaying pending and accepted teams. My current focus is to handle real-time UI updates to ensure the user receives accurate information. I am using the check and X icons to style the buttons, for visual clarity and feedback.\n\n\n\n",

      "text": "**Considering Component Updates**\n\nI'm focusing on incorporating skill tags into the completed matches display within the Live Scoreboard. My current thinking revolves around updating the `MatchRow` component, which is used for both upcoming and completed matches. I'm aiming to modify the display in `components/LiveScoreboard.tsx` to include the referee notes in completed matches specifically.\n\n\n**Implementing Referee Notes**\n\nI've examined the `MatchRow` component within `components/LiveScoreboard.tsx` and have a clear path forward. My plan is to add a conditional check to display `match.refereeNotes` when a match has a `MatchStatus.COMPLETED` status. I'm focusing on pulling `refereeNotes` from the `Match` interface, which is defined in `types.ts`, where it's correctly typed as an optional string array.\n\n\n**Refining Conditional Logic**\n\nI'm now refining the conditional logic within the `MatchRow` component in `components/LiveScoreboard.tsx`. My focus is on ensuring the \"Final\" display is included only for matches in a completed state. I'm aiming for a clean and efficient implementation that avoids unnecessary conditional rendering.\n\n\n**Adjusting Component Layout**\n\nI'm now revising the layout of the `MatchRow` component to incorporate the display of referee notes neatly. The goal is a more elegant presentation. I'm modifying the component's container from a flex row to a flex column layout. This will allow the referee notes section, with its tags, to appear below the main match details, while keeping the score section as is. This makes more efficient use of space and improves readability.\n\n\n**Optimizing Layout Structure**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best structural approach for the `MatchRow` component. My thinking leans toward either wrapping existing content in a parent `div` or refactoring the outer `div` to a `flex-col` layout. I'm focusing on preserving the current horizontal structure for the core match data while enabling a vertical stack for referee notes. My goal is a visually clean and intuitive layout using the described styles.\n\n\n**Finalizing Referee Note Display**\n\nI'm now implementing the detailed formatting for referee notes within the `MatchRow` component. I'm focusing on ensuring the display is clean and readable, especially with the use of appropriate spacing and font styles. My goal is to make sure that the referee notes are easily distinguishable from the rest of the match data. I've placed the referee notes below the main match information. I'm also ensuring the \"Final\" display is included only for matches in a completed state.\n\n\n**Integrating Skill Tags**\n\nI'm now integrating the display of skill tags within the `MatchRow` component to include in the completed match section, as well. I'm focusing on updating `components/LiveScoreboard.tsx`. This logic applies to all matches rendered by `MatchRow`, including completed ones. I'm aiming to ensure that the skill tags from the referee notes are also rendered correctly in the complete match displays.\n\n\n**Refreshing Tournament Data**\n\nI'm now focusing on implementing a 2-second refresh for tournament data using `setInterval` within `useEffect`. I've added a cleanup function to clear the interval on unmount. If no tournament is active, I'm displaying a \"No active tournament\" message. I'm also now filtering matches into \"live\", \"upcoming\", and \"completed\" categories, applying a scheduled time sort to the \"upcoming\" matches, and reversing the order of the \"completed\" matches.\n\n\n**Refining Live Match Display**\n\nI'm now integrating the `LiveMatchCard` component to display real-time match data. My focus is on ensuring a clear and concise presentation of live matches, including team names and scores. I'm focusing on incorporating the `teams` data into the `LiveMatchCard` component for proper rendering. I'm ensuring this is styled to fit within the scoreboard design. I've also implemented a message for when no matches are in progress.\n\n\n**Organizing Upcoming Matches**\n\nI'm now separating \"upcoming\" and \"completed\" match sections within the Live Scoreboard. The goal is to improve the user interface. I'm focusing on creating distinct displays for upcoming and completed matches. I'm also including a clear \"No upcoming/completed matches\" message when the respective list is empty. I've used `useEffect` to manage the fetching and display of tournament data.\n\n\n\n**Displaying Live Match Data**\n\nI'm now integrating the `LiveMatchCard` to display live match information with team details. I'm prioritizing concise, real-time match presentations. The goal is to clearly show the live matches within the scoreboard design. I'm focusing on ensuring data-correctness for team names and the current scores in the `LiveMatchCard`. I've added a message for when there are no live matches.\n\n\n**Refining Score Display**\n\nI'm now refining the score display within the `LiveMatchCard` component for better clarity. I'm focusing on improved formatting for game scores, and set scores. I'm prioritizing clear and concise presentation, ensuring that the score information is easily understood at a glance. I'm working on ensuring the layout of the score is legible in the Live Match Card.\n\n\n**Refining Team Data Display**\n\nI'm now integrating the team data within the `MatchRow` component to enhance match presentations. I'm focusing on incorporating team names and logos, as appropriate, in both upcoming and completed matches. My goal is to use the existing team data to avoid redundant API calls. I'm prioritizing accuracy for this update. I am also working on rendering placeholder matches for unfinished tournaments in `MatchRow`. I am making sure the layout renders correctly, even in cases where teams are not yet determined.\n\n\n\n**Enhancing Team Displays**\n\nI'm now integrating team name and score displays within the Live Scoreboard. I'm focusing on ensuring clear and dynamic representation of live match scores and team information. I am working on using the new team data and scores to render team names correctly, and I'm ensuring score correctness. I am currently focusing on refining the `MatchRow` component for display and data integration, and making sure placeholder matches render appropriately for unfinished tournaments.\n\n\n",

      "text": "**Considering Local Storage Deployment**\n\nI am now focused on helping the user deploy their website, specifically addressing their request regarding \"cache memory\". I'm interpreting this as a need for a client-side persistence mechanism. I'm exploring the most suitable options for local storage within a frontend-only application, bearing in mind ease of use and long term application performance. I am also planning on documenting the key factors.\n\n\n**Evaluating Image Storage Solutions**\n\nI'm now diving into the user's need for storing and displaying player photos. Initially, I'm considering `localStorage`, which is already used for the database, `padel_pro_db_v1`. My current focus involves assessing its capacity for Base64 encoded images. I'm checking the current player object which has a `photoUrl` field. I am also planning on exploring the limits of `localStorage` to determine if I need to move to a solution like `IndexedDB`.\n\n\n**Refining Image Processing Plan**\n\nI've refined the plan to enhance image handling for the MVP. Specifically, I need to add image upload functionality to `RegistrationForm.tsx`, convert files to Base64 strings with resizing to fit within `localStorage`. Then, update `RefereeInterface.tsx` to display these images. The `storage.ts` module may or may not need an update, depending on the implementation. I'm focusing on ensuring these images are properly resized/compressed before storage to accommodate a maximum of 32 teams with potentially full-resolution images.\n\n\n**Confirming Browser Storage Choice**\n\nI've determined the user is likely referring to browser storage, and I'm sticking with `localStorage` for now, assuming sufficient image compression. I'm focusing on the implementation details. I've scoped out the changes needed in `RegistrationForm.tsx` to include image upload and resizing.\nI will also need to update `RefereeInterface.tsx` to display images, if they exist. No changes seem needed to `types.ts` or `storage.ts`, because Base64 strings are just strings, and localStorage can handle strings.\n\n\n**Implementing Image Display Logic**\n\nI'm now implementing the image display in `RefereeInterface.tsx`, focusing on utilizing the `img` tag with the `src` attribute populated from `winner.player1.photoUrl`. I need to ensure that the image is properly displayed when available. Also, I'm noting the need to add error handling or a try-catch block in `storage.ts` to manage potential `localStorage` quota errors.\n\n\n**Refining Registration Process**\n\nI'm now integrating image upload and processing within `RegistrationForm.tsx`. I've added `handleImageChange` and file input elements. I'm focusing on image compression to stay below 50kb and store it in `formData`. Afterward, it will be passed to `registerTeam`. I plan to keep the helper function inside `RegistrationForm` if it simplifies the code, making the setup more streamlined. I'm now writing the code.\n\n\n**Finalizing Storage Implementation**\n\nI've completed image integration. Now I've added a file input and event handler in `RegistrationForm.tsx` to get and resize images, converting to Base64 within the same component. The updated `RefereeInterface.tsx` component now displays the `photoUrl`. This should satisfy the core requirements. I've re-reviewed the requirements, and I'm confident in my choices. I will now prepare the documentation.\n\n\n",

      "text": "**Analyzing Mobile Responsiveness**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the mobile experience, pinpointing areas where responsiveness falters. It's clear that the current implementation isn't optimized for smaller screens. I'm focusing on the Tailwind CSS classes and how they're applied to achieve a better layout. I plan to refine the styles for a better outcome.\n\n\n**Refining Mobile UI**\n\nI'm now diving into the component structure, specifically focusing on `Layout.tsx` and `LiveScoreboard.tsx` to ensure seamless mobile rendering. I've pinpointed the horizontal navigation overflow in the `Layout`'s mobile view as a potential clutter point. The `LiveScoreboard` is the next target for responsiveness improvements. My next step will be to explore and implement alternative mobile navigation strategies and component adjustments.\n\n\n**Assessing Visual Elements**\n\nI'm now assessing specific UI elements for mobile. I see that stacking behavior for grid layouts is as expected. However, text sizing within `LiveMatchCard` might be too large for compact screens. I'm taking a look at `MatchRow` which may be tight. I'm focusing on the `RefereeInterface`, specifically the scoring control which has a complex structure that might break mobile layouts.\n\n\n**Evaluating Mobile Grid Display**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on grid layouts' mobile behavior, particularly for components using `grid-cols-2`. It seems side-by-side controls may be cramped, so `flex-col` is looking like a safer choice for button elements, especially if buttons are larger. The `WinnerBanner`'s padding and text sizes (`p-12`, `text-6xl md:text-8xl`) look excessive on smaller screens, and the avatar dimensions (`w-32 h-32`) might be large. I'm noting the `Match List` should be fine. Finally, the form layout within `AdminDashboard.tsx` with its `grid md:grid-cols-2` and `grid grid-cols-2` also needs adjustment to ensure inputs don't overflow on small screens. I'm considering `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2` for specific fields.\n\n**Refactoring Mobile Navigation**\n\nI'm now focusing on `Layout.tsx` and the mobile navigation. I'm exploring a native bottom bar or a simplified top bar. The `overflow-x-auto` strategy seems passable, but truncating labels and using icons may be better for space. The logic for hiding labels in the navigation bar using `hidden lg:block` may be too coarse. I need to review and potentially modify these implementations.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Mobile Adjustments**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on UI components. The `RefereeInterface.tsx` scoring display is a top priority, needing conversion from `grid-cols-[1fr_auto_1fr]` to `flex flex-col` or `grid-cols-1` on mobile. The `LiveMatchCard` text sizes and `MatchRow` flex behavior are also on the immediate to-do list, and I'll adapt form layouts in `AdminDashboard.tsx` to use mobile-friendly grid columns. I am keeping in mind the `RegistrationForm.tsx` which is okay. Next, the scoring display will be my focus.\n\n\n**Optimizing Mobile Scoreboard**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the `RefereeInterface`'s scoreboard. The initial approach with `grid-cols-[1fr_auto_1fr]` wasn't ideal for mobile. I've shifted to a `flex flex-col` structure, and it looks a lot better. For mobile, it will be a vertical stack like: Team 1 Info | Scoreboard | Team 2 Info. I've also been thinking about the `LiveMatchCard` text sizes and nav bar look.\n\n\n**Implementing Mobile Typography**\n\nI'm now implementing the latest adjustments. I'm focusing on the `LiveScoreboard`, and the `LiveMatchCard`, considering reducing the text size on mobile, and the `AdminDashboard`, and fixing the form grids. Also, I need to check the margins/padding of the `RegistrationForm`. I'm starting the `RefereeInterface` next, by revising the scoreboard layout and the winner banner's responsiveness. I'm considering text-lg or text-xl. I'm moving forward now.\n\n\n**Adjusting Mobile Components**\n\nI'm now implementing recent changes to UI components. I've updated the padding, text sizes, and flex layouts in several components. Specifically, I've adjusted the padding in `WinnerBanner` and reduced text sizes in `LiveMatchCard` and the padding in `AdminDashboard`. The navigation styling in `Layout.tsx` will receive additional fine-tuning, and I'm currently working on improving the mobile navigation. I'm focusing on text and UI elements to refine their presentation.\n\n\n**Refining Mobile Navigation**\n\nI'm now refining the navigation bar styles in `Layout.tsx` for a cleaner mobile experience. I'm focusing on text and icons for the navigation bar, and adjusting the positioning. I'm moving toward a more streamlined presentation for smaller screens and the implementation is looking better. I will continue to focus on the `LiveMatchCard` text sizes.\n\n\n**Evaluating Mobile Navigation**\n\nI'm now assessing the `Layout.tsx` mobile navigation implementation. The text, icons, and position are adjusted now for the mobile screen, and improvements are evident. I'm satisfied with the refined mobile presentation, and I will continue to finalize the `LiveMatchCard` text sizes and nav bar look. I'm confident about these tweaks to navigation.\n\n\n**Streamlining Navigation Logic**\n\nI'm now streamlining the navigation logic, considering how to handle the different screen sizes. I've also refactored `Layout.tsx`, focusing on how the navigation items and the layout behave together. The current layout is more streamlined now on mobile, and I am satisfied with the responsiveness. I'm prioritizing the layout and presentation to make it more user-friendly.\n\n\n**Refining Navigation Presentation**\n\nI'm now refining the presentation of the navigation items. I'm focusing on the component structure, specifically the conditional classes that show a highlight only when active, and adjusting the text and icons to work well together. The code is looking better, and more readable now. I'm moving toward an improved layout presentation.\n\n\n**Improving Navigation Elements**\n\nI'm now focusing on navigation item presentation within `Layout.tsx` for optimal display. I'm addressing the conditional scaling and visibility of the icons and labels, ensuring they're clear and consistent across screen sizes. The code will be better, with better navigation elements. I am pleased with the refinement.\n\n\n**Analyzing Tournament Display**\n\nI'm now analyzing the presentation of the tournament details, specifically focusing on how the information is structured and displayed across various screen sizes. I'm taking a close look at the layout of the `Match Up` section and the text sizes. I need to improve readability. I'm focusing on the font sizes, especially the heading and subheading, to ensure they are visually appealing and easily legible on all devices.\n\n\n**Refining Live Match Display**\n\nI'm now refining the presentation of live match information within the dashboard. I'm focusing on the `LiveAction` section, especially the live indicator and the grid display of `LiveMatchCard` components. I am considering adjusting padding. I'm taking a close look at how these elements scale on different devices. I'm considering using `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2` and adjusting the padding.\n\n\n**Optimizing Match List Display**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the display of upcoming and completed matches within the dashboard. The `MatchRow` components' presentation is a core area for improvement, and I'll focus on the display and readability of the match details across screen sizes. The font sizes of the heading and subheading are next. I'm taking a close look at the layout of the `Match Up` section and text sizes.\n\n\n**Refining MatchCard UI**\n\nI'm now refining the visual presentation of the `LiveMatchCard` component. The `LiveMatchCard` is looking better. I'm focusing on the font sizes within the card, and am happy with the layout. I've streamlined the text layout, and I'm ready to move on.\n\n\n**Adjusting LiveMatchCard Text**\n\nI'm now focusing on text scaling within the `LiveMatchCard`, specifically the team names and scores. The team name's font-size, initially set at `text-lg md:text-2xl`, might be too large for small screens. I'm testing `text-base` for smaller screens, alongside smaller padding. I'm also ensuring the score display adapts correctly across all devices. The text is looking much better.\n\n\n**Refining Point Display**\n\nI'm now refining the point display within the `LiveMatchCard` component for better mobile legibility. I am looking into the size and spacing of point numbers. I've noted the `font-mono` class for the numbers, and I'll make sure it's legible across the display. I'm focusing on the font size and padding. I'll test smaller text and reduce the overall card size, if needed.\n\n\n**Improving Match Card Text**\n\nI'm now revising the scaling of text within `LiveMatchCard` for optimal clarity on mobile. I'm focusing on team names and scores. Reducing font size to `text-sm` for smaller screens, alongside smaller padding. The point display now looks better. I'm pleased with the revised layout.\n\n\n**Adjusting Match Display**\n\nI'm now implementing recent refinements. I'm focusing on the `LiveMatchCard` component's display of match status and time, and the referee notes, by revising the padding, text size, and conditional rendering. Specifically, I am focusing on the match status text size, and the padding of referee notes. The goal is a more compact and readable presentation on smaller screens.\n\n\n**Implementing Referee Interface**\n\nI'm now implementing the `RefereeInterface`. I'm integrating the authentication logic to handle passcode entry, and managing the state for login status. I'm also preparing for the display of matches. I am now working on the display logic, authentication, and the winner banner state. Next, I will be testing these implementations.\n\n\n**Implementing Referee Logic**\n\nI'm now integrating the referee interface with the UI, focusing on the login form and conditional display. The conditional rendering for displaying the login form based on authentication state is now implemented. I'm focusing on the login form and its state, including passcode handling. Now I'm preparing to display matches after successful login and will refine the overall visual presentation of the interface next.\n\n\n**Refining Passcode Form**\n\nI'm now refining the passcode entry form within the `RefereeInterface`. I'm focusing on text input for mobile legibility, specifically the form. The text and button's visual presentation now looks better. I'm focusing on input field style and submission button presentation to improve the UI on smaller screens, and it is looking good now.\n\n\n**Analyzing Match Details**\n\nI'm now analyzing the rendering of match details and card components within the dashboard. I've taken a close look at text scaling within `LiveMatchCard`, specifically the team names and status updates, including the scheduled time. I am now refining font sizes to better accommodate varying screen sizes, ensuring the overall display is both clean and informative, including the match status.

This is a standard mobile app pattern that improves reachability.\n    *   The sidebar layout remains for desktop screens.\n    *   Added a small top header with the logo for mobile view to ensure brand visibility.\n\n2.  **Live Scoreboard (`components/LiveScoreboard.tsx`):**\n    *   Adjusted grid layouts to single columns on mobile.\n    *   Scaled down font sizes for match cards (team names, scores) to prevent text overflow on smaller screens.\n    *   Refined padding and margins to utilize screen real estate better.\n\n3.  **Referee Interface (`components/RefereeInterface.tsx`):**\n    *   **Major Change:** The scoring control panel now stacks vertically on mobile. This prevents the \"Team 1 - Score - Team 2\" horizontal layout from being squashed.\n    *   The layout is now: Team 1 (Top) -> Scoreboard (Middle) -> Team 2 (Bottom).\n    *   Increased touch targets for \"Point\" buttons on mobile.\n    *   Made the \"Winner Banner\" responsive by stacking player photos and adjusting the massive text sizes for smaller screens.\n\n4.  **Admin Dashboard (`components/AdminDashboard.tsx`):**\n    *   Changed form grids from 2 columns to 1 column on mobile to make input fields wider and easier to type in.\n\n5.  **Registration Form (`components/RegistrationForm.tsx`):**\n    *   Added bottom padding (`pb-20`) to ensure the submit button isn't covered by the new bottom navigation bar.\n\nHere are the updated files:\n\n",

The conditional rendering in `AdminDashboard.tsx` seems to control the \"Generate Bracket\" button. My initial thoughts are that we can remove the condition: `{activeTournament.matches.length === 0}` to make the button always available to the admin.\n\n\n**Refining Bracket Re-generation**\n\nI'm now refining the bracket re-generation process. My current approach involves updating `AdminDashboard.tsx` to always display the \"Regenerate Bracket\" button, adding a confirmation dialog if matches already exist, to prevent data loss. Simultaneously, I'm adjusting `services/storage.ts` to ensure that the `generateSchedule` function overwrites existing match data, effectively allowing a fresh bracket each time.\n\n\n**Adjusting Bracket UI**\n\nI'm now focusing on refining the UI for bracket regeneration. I've updated `AdminDashboard.tsx` to dynamically label the button as \"Regenerate Bracket\" if matches exist, and \"Generate Bracket\" otherwise. I also need to add a warning prompt before regenerating to prevent any unintentional data loss.\n\n\n",

      "text": "**Considering Cloud Migration**\n\nI'm currently focused on transitioning the data persistence layer from localStorage to Google Cloud Firestore. While exploring Google Cloud services in general, Firestore's NoSQL capabilities appear best suited to the application's needs. This migration aims for increased reliability and scalability.\n\n\n**Re-evaluating Approach**\n\nI've hit a roadblock. It seems I am using the wrong tool. The provided context leans heavily towards Google's Generative AI features, using the `@google/genai` library, which is not designed for direct database interaction as I had previously assumed. I need to figure out how to satisfy the need to \"save the data of the app activity on the cloud\" using the appropriate Google Cloud services that are compatible with the specified SDK and environment constraints. This includes considering real-time data sync across multiple tournaments.\n\n\n**Simulating Cloud Storage**\n\nI'm now viewing this as a local state versus backend state issue. I can't directly leverage Google Cloud services in this environment. The challenge is ensuring real-time data sync across sessions. I must simulate cloud storage, perhaps using a key-value store approach if possible, or build as if external cloud data is available. The user's expectation of cloud access demands this.\n\n\n**Clarifying Backend Requirements**\n\nI'm now recognizing a potential user misunderstanding. The initial \"Google Cloud Services\" request might be misinterpreting the available tools. I have to figure out how to satisfy the need to \"save data\", given my constraints. The strict system instructions, restricting me to `@google/genai` and file modifications, limit backend integration. I will need to alert the user of this limitation, and suggest a workaround if possible.\n\n\n**Investigating Implementation Options**\n\nI'm now contemplating several approaches to address the \"cloud storage\" request within these constraints. Considering this frontend context, I'm leaning toward simulating cloud storage, but I also have to consider available resources. Using a free JSON bin service is an option, and I have to weigh its inherent insecurity. The existing `localStorage` approach doesn't sync, which isn't sufficient. Finally, importing Firebase via CDN, might satisfy the \"Google Cloud Services\" request. I have to check the imports in `index.html`, and update `storage.ts` if Firebase is implemented.\n\n\n**Addressing Authentication Needs**\n\nI'm now grappling with authentication. The immediate problem is the lack of Firebase configuration details. It's too risky to generate code expecting these constants. I'm re-interpreting the prompt, and I'm rejecting any Gemini API as a data storage solution, as it is stateless. Given the instructions, and constraints, I must structure the code to *allow* for persistence but can't fully implement it without backend access. I have to avoid making direct API calls. A demo key-value store might still work.\n\n\n**Implementing Firebase Integration**\n\nI'm now focusing on Firebase integration. My decision is to switch the storage engine to Firebase Firestore, which falls under Google Cloud services. I'll update `index.html` to include Firebase SDKs and update `storage.ts` to utilize Firestore for all CRUD operations, replacing `localStorage`. I'm using `process.env` placeholders within the code, as the prompt specifies `process.env.API_KEY`, but I'll also add clear comments to guide the user in inserting their configuration details. I am now proceeding with Firebase Firestore as a plausible fulfillment, while still following the instructions regarding environment variables.\n\n\n**Integrating Firebase Services**\n\nI'm now implementing Firebase to simulate the requested cloud functionality. I'll modify `index.html` to import the necessary Firebase libraries. Then, I will refactor `services/storage.ts` to utilize Firebase Firestore, replacing local storage calls with asynchronous Firestore operations. This means all components that call the store must be modified to handle the async Firestore calls and the real-time changes using the snapshot listener instead of polling or synchronous calls.\n\n\n**Refactoring Data Persistence**\n\nI'm now integrating Firebase Firestore to fulfill the cloud storage requirement. This requires substantial modifications, including migrating from synchronous calls to asynchronous ones. The `RefereeInterface.tsx` is being adapted for async score updates, and `storage.ts` will manage real-time updates using Firestore listeners. I also have to implement tournament creation and selection features.\n\n\n**Refining Tournament Flow**\n\nI'm now refining the navigation flow. I'm structuring a better interface with Home/Live, Register, and Admin sections for multiple tournaments. I'm facing the challenge of handling missing Firebase configuration. I'll add a `config.ts` or inline instructions to `storage.ts` to guide the user to paste their Firebase config. There's also the environment variable for API keys, which only applies to `@google/genai`, not Firebase. My biggest concern right now is that I need to convert existing sync calls to async for Firebase.\n\n\n**Evaluating Firebase Integration**\n\nI'm now determining the most effective integration approach. I'll focus on Firebase configuration in `index.html` by using importmaps for Firebase libraries. Then, I plan to refactor `storage.ts` to initialize Firebase and refactor functions like `getCurrentTournament` and mutations to use Firestore asynchronously with listener callbacks. This involves making `LiveScoreboard.tsx` display a \"Tournament List\" if none are available.\n\n\n**Addressing Configuration Challenges**\n\nI'm now focusing on the Firebase configuration issue, a critical constraint. My plan is to include a `firebaseConfig.ts` file (or embed the config details in `storage.ts`). I'll implement placeholder values and add a UI alert or code comment if the configuration is missing, to prevent application crashes and facilitate user setup. This ensures the prompt's requirements are met by demonstrating the integration, even without direct access to the user's config. I am also adjusting components like the `AdminDashboard`, `RegistrationForm`, and `RefereeInterface` to handle asynchronous operations and tournament selection.\n\n\n**Syncing Calls to Async**\n\nNow, I'm adapting the codebase for asynchronous operations and multi-tournament selection. I'm focusing on the `LiveScoreboard`, `RegistrationForm`, and `AdminDashboard` components. I am using `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for real-time updates through Firestore listeners. I also have to configure `index.html` with Firebase imports, and refactor `storage.ts` to switch to Firestore and integrate a multi-tournament selection interface. The largest effort is in replacing the sync functions to async.\n\n\n**Defining Data Structure**\n\nI am now focusing on the optimal data structure within Firestore. I've decided to store tournament data, including teams and matches, as nested objects within each tournament document, which simplifies the migration from the current JSON structure. I'm prioritizing the MVP approach, so the scalability of subcollections isn't necessary.\n\n\n\n**Initiating Code Implementation**\n\nI'm now implementing the Firebase integration with the code. I am focusing on adapting the UI to support multi-tournament selection. I will integrate a display listing to view active tournaments in the `LiveScoreboard`, and I will add a dropdown list for tournament selection within the `RegistrationForm`. I am also planning a listing of tournaments within the `AdminDashboard`. Finally, I'm noting the need to handle images by using Base64 encoding for storage in Firestore.\n\n\n**Refactoring for Robustness**\n\nI'm now implementing the Firebase structure. I'll include Firebase imports in `index.html` and rewrite `storage.ts` to utilize Firestore, incorporating `initializeApp`, `getFirestore`, `collection`, `addDoc`, `onSnapshot`, `doc`, and `updateDoc` functions. If config is absent, I am ignoring the fallback to local storage, and focusing on cloud implementation as requested. I'm also addressing the admin ID limitation by removing the hardcoded check for user 'zayam@test.com' in the AdminDashboard. I might simply eliminate auth completely for the MVP, or allow any email/password combo to suffice.\n\n\n**Updating UI Integration**\n\nI am now focusing on refining the UI and the Firebase configuration. I'm streamlining the authentication approach and have converted \"Sign In\" to \"Enter Name\" with a shared system password for identity, which fulfills the multi-admin requirement, for this demonstration. I have adjusted the `AdminDashboard` to list active tournaments with a \"Create New\" button. The `LiveScoreboard` is updated to include a tournament selection interface. I am also preparing the XML and refactoring code. I'll provide a dummy Firebase config within the codebase, alongside instructions to the user to insert their credentials for proper operation.\n\n\n\n**Integrating Tournament Selectors**\n\nI'm now integrating tournament selectors into key components. The `RegistrationForm` and `RefereeInterface` will include tournament selection. I'm choosing a localized approach for tournament state management within each component, given the current application structure, to maintain simplicity. I will also be focusing on adapting the structure to accept callbacks for Firestore operations.\n\n\\n\\n\n**Defining Firebase Structures**\n\nI am now focusing on setting up the Firebase data structures and defining the Firebase listeners for the code, to use to integrate Firebase. I'm focusing on defining the `subscribeToTournaments` function with a callback to observe data changes. Then I will be defining `subscribeToTournament` using `doc(db, 'tournaments', id)` with callbacks. Also defining `createTournament`, as well as `updateMatchScore` that will update an array.\n\n\n**Implementing Firebase Calls**\n\nI am now implementing the various functions to be called with the Firestore implementation, for this demonstration. I have defined `subscribeToTournaments`, using callbacks to observe data changes. `subscribeToTournament`, using `doc(db, 'tournaments', id)` with callbacks is also defined. I am also implementing `createTournament` and `updateMatchScore` that will update an array. The plan is to continue to rewrite parts of the code to use these new functions.\n\n\n**Defining Firebase Integration**\n\nI'm now integrating Firebase throughout the codebase, starting with the implementation of `subscribeToTournaments`, using callbacks to observe the data, and `subscribeToTournament`, using `doc(db, 'tournaments', id)` with callbacks. I'm also implementing the `createTournament` and `updateMatchScore` methods, and plan to rewrite parts of the code to use these new functions.\n\n\n**Implementing Data Retrieval**\n\nI am now implementing Firebase in various parts of the code. I've focused on creating `subscribeToTournaments` using callbacks for real-time data observation and `subscribeToTournament` using callbacks for retrieving data. Also created `createTournament`, as well as `updateMatchScore` that will update an array. I am also planning the refactor of current code that is dependent on `localStorage` to incorporate these Firebase calls and implementations.\n\n\n**Finalizing Cloud Implementation**\n\nI'm now implementing the Firebase data structure within the codebase to simulate cloud-based storage. The plan is to create `subscribeToTournaments` using callbacks for real-time observation and also to implement `subscribeToTournament`, using callbacks for data. I am also implementing `createTournament` and `updateMatchScore` methods, and then will rewrite code to use these new functions.

      "text": "**Considering Data Migration**\n\nI'm currently focused on migrating the application's data storage. My primary goal is to shift from the limitations of `localStorage` to the real-time synchronization and multi-user capabilities offered by Google Cloud Firestore. This should enable access across multiple devices.\n\n\n**Updating Cloud Migration**\n\nI'm now integrating Firebase via `esm.sh` into the project, updating `index.html` as needed, and I am rewriting `services/storage.ts` to use Firestore for real-time data persistence. The structure is based around multiple tournaments, with multi-device support. The overall objective is multi-user access across multiple devices, which I should be able to achieve with Firestore.\n\n\n**Refactoring Architecture**\n\nI am now structuring the data access around a central `db` instance from Firestore. I am focusing on replacing all the `localStorage` calls with Firestore equivalents: `getDocs`, `addDoc`, etc. I am addressing asynchronous data fetching by implementing subscription to tournaments, and updating components such as `LiveScoreboard`, `AdminDashboard`, `RefereeInterface`, and `RegistrationForm` to handle asynchronous operations and data updates.\n\n\n**Refining Realtime Updates**\n\nI'm now changing functions to use Promises or callbacks for real-time updates. I am thinking of using Firestore's real-time capabilities to handle tournament listing instead of relying on local storage, and the registration page should show available tournaments. I'm updating several components: `App.tsx`, `LiveScoreboard.tsx`, `AdminDashboard.tsx`, `RegistrationForm.tsx`, and `RefereeInterface.tsx`. I am planning a `tournaments` collection in Firestore, with a document for each `tournamentId`.\n\n\n**Analyzing Data Structure**\n\nI am evaluating the ideal structure for storing tournament data within Firestore. I've considered using sub-collections for `teams` and `matches` but, for the MVP and simplicity, I've decided to keep `teams` and `matches` as arrays within the main `Tournament` document to match the existing `types.ts` structure. This will minimize refactoring of component logic. I'm prioritizing minimal changes. This decision aligns with the goal of saving all data and making related data changes in Google Cloud.\n\n\n**Addressing Concurrency**\n\nI'm now focusing on safe updates to match scores. My plan is to use Firestore's `updateDoc` method, aiming for simplicity. I'm considering the potential impact of array updates and the limitations of Firestore document size (1MB), especially considering Base64 encoded images. I've concluded that sticking with Firestore for data is acceptable for the project's scope, including the images as is, since they were already compressed to 300px. I'll need to update components such as `LiveScoreboard` and `AdminDashboard` to account for asynchronous data fetching.\n\n\n**Implementing Listeners**\n\nI am now implementing Firestore listeners in `RefereeInterface` and `RegistrationForm` using `useEffect` for real-time updates. Also, I'm updating `services/storage.ts` with new method signatures: `subscribeToTournament`, `subscribeToActiveTournaments`, `createTournament`, and `registerTeam`, all of which should be asynchronous. I will focus on updating the required components to function with these new storage changes.\n\n\n**Planning UI Adjustments**\n\nI'm now focusing on refining the UI for multi-tournament support. I will modify `RegistrationForm` to display active tournaments and `LiveScoreboard` to show a list or default to the most recent one. Also, `AdminDashboard` will be modified to list all tournaments. I'm updating the Firebase setup in `services/storage.ts` using the modular SDK. I've realized I can't inject the user's API key.\n\n\n**Developing Firebase Logic**\n\nI'm now in the thick of coding the Firebase interactions, starting with `services/storage.ts`. I'm implementing subscription functions for tournaments and individual tournament data and updating functions for creating tournaments, registering teams, and updating match scores. I plan to use `updateDoc` for score updates, aiming for efficient asynchronous data management, and I'll adapt several components for the UI changes. I am leaving placeholders for the user's API key.\n\n\n**Integrating Firebase Functionality**\n\nI'm now integrating Firebase by updating the import map in `index.html` and replacing local storage logic with Firestore calls in `services/storage.ts`. I am creating a hook using `useEffect` in the components, and refactoring several components for the new async/listener pattern.\n\n\n**Optimizing Data Storage**\n\nI'm now focusing on optimizing the data storage strategy within Firestore, since the images are getting close to the 1MB limit with 32 teams. I will stick to the document model for now, but will make use of `onSnapshot` to see if the user hits the limit. If it's too much, re-architecting to subcollections is a huge change. I am going to try it first, and then I may optimize where possible.\n\n\n**Adjusting Registration Logic**\n\nI am now focusing on refining the `RegistrationForm`. I will list tournaments that have a status that is not equal to COMPLETED. I'm also planning to modify the `RefereeInterface`. The UX of picking the tournament first, then entering the passcode is better. Finally, I will be updating the import map in `index.html` with `esm.sh` for the React Firebase imports, and stripping out any `export const getCurrentTournament` instances.\n\n\n**Refactoring Components**\n\nI'm now refactoring multiple components to support multi-tournament functionality. I'm focusing on minimizing UI changes while enabling features. The plan is to change how the data flow is handled, so components manage the ID, and I will be removing synchronous helper functions, which read state. For a simple UI, there will be a list shown if there is no tournament selected. I'll handle the \"Active Tournament\" selection inside each tab.\n\n\n",

      "text": "**Analyzing the Schedule Function**\n\nI'm currently focused on the root problem: the 'Round Robin' tournament format isn't working as intended. My initial investigation of the `generateSchedule` function in `services/storage.ts` reveals it's set up for single-elimination brackets, which is not the goal. This helps narrow down the areas needing attention, specifically within that function's scope.\n\n\n**Refining the Round Robin**\n\nI'm now diving deeper into how to handle Round Robin functionality, focusing on group management. I've noted the `TournamentFormat` enum and the `Team` interface in `types.ts` are ready for Round Robin. However, `generateSchedule` in `services/storage.ts` needs a major overhaul to avoid single elimination logic. I'm thinking I must add a loop that generates a full schedule with a bracket for each group, and I also need to make sure the score updates also affect the wins, losses, and points in the Team interface.\n\n\n**Defining Match Generation**\n\nI'm now outlining the steps to make a proper schedule for the Round Robin format. The teams in a group will have to face each other. I also must calculate the points to determine group winners. After the group stage, top teams advance to a knockout bracket, such as the Semifinals and Final. I'm updating `generateSchedule` in `services/storage.ts` to implement this. I plan to shuffle the teams and split them into groups, then generate matches within those groups.\n\n\n**Implementing Score Updates**\n\nI'm now focusing on how match results update team statistics. When a match is marked complete, I'll update the `Team` stats like wins, losses, and points in the tournament data. I'm leaning toward a simpler MVP approach, updating wins and losses directly upon match completion. I'll need to figure out how I should calculate playoff advancement, though, whether in the UI or an admin button.\n\n\n\n**Structuring the Matches**\n\nI'm now thinking about organizing the matches within groups, like \"Group A\" and \"Group B\", which is critical for standings. With an 8-team tournament, I'm imagining 2 groups of 4. Each group requires six matches, totaling twelve group matches. The top two teams from each group advance to the semi-finals, following with A1 vs B2, B1 vs A2, etc. The match data will include a 'stage' ('GROUP', 'PLAYOFF') and a 'groupName' ('A', 'B') field. I'm focusing on refining how this data structure will inform the schedule generation.\n\n\n**Prioritizing UI-Driven Stats**\n\nI've decided to recalculate team stats in the UI. Instead of storing calculated standings, I'll generate them in real-time. This eliminates race conditions in Firestore when updating stats. I'm focusing on adding a Standings tab or section to the `LiveScoreboard` to display these calculations. I believe this will be a safer approach for this architecture. Also, I'll update the `Match` interface to include 'group' and 'stage' in `types.ts`.\n\n\n**Refining Standings Calculations**\n\nI'm now implementing the `updateTournamentStandings` function within `storage.ts`. This will iterate through completed matches to update the `Team` object's wins and points in Firestore. This is triggered after any match is marked complete. I'm also preparing to add the 'group' and 'stage' fields to the `Match` object in `types.ts`, and am about to rewrite the `generateSchedule` function. My focus is on making the group tables appear on the `LiveScoreboard`.\n\n\n**Implementing Groupings and Matches**\n\nI'm now implementing the group creation and match generation for the Round Robin. I've decided to handle the team distribution sequentially. For each group, I'll generate the required matches. I'm also adding placeholders for the semi-finals and final. I will use a snake draft for team placement. The `calculateStandings` function will reset the teams stats, then will loop through matches, updating wins, losses, and potentially set differences.\n\n\n",

      "type": "thinking",
      "text": "**Addressing the Error**\n\nOkay, I'm focusing on the \"Cannot find name 'ChevronRight'\" error in `AdminDashboard.tsx`. I suspect I need to import `ChevronRight` from `lucide-react`, which is the likely source for this component. I'm going to add that import statement and see if it resolves the issue.\n\n\n**Defining the 'Input' Component**\n\nI'm now investigating the \"Cannot find name 'Input'\" error in `RegistrationForm.tsx`. I believe the `Input` component is either undefined or imported incorrectly. Since the file's snippet is cut off, and no other files mention `Input`, I'll start by defining a basic `Input` component within `RegistrationForm.tsx` to get things working, and complete the file if necessary.\n\n\n**Reconstructing the Form**\n\nI'm now reconstructing `RegistrationForm.tsx`. It seems the error \"Cannot find name 'Input'\" suggests a missing or incorrectly imported local helper component, and the file is truncated. My approach is to include the missing parts, and define the `Input` component within `RegistrationForm.tsx` to get this to work. I will start by completing the file.\n\n\n**Refactoring the Interface**\n\nI'm now overhauling the `RefereeInterface.tsx`. My current thinking is that the original sync call to `getCurrentTournament()` is inappropriate for async data fetching. I'm leaning towards modifying the interface to allow selection of a tournament by the user. I'll utilize `useEffect` and `subscribeToTournaments` to fetch tournaments and let the referee select one, similar to how I've implemented in other components.\n\n\n**Resolving the Argument Error**\n\nI'm now pinpointing the argument error in `RefereeInterface.tsx`, specifically within `ScoringControl`. The `handlePoint` function expects two arguments (team and player index), but the problem isn't provided as a code snippet. The error occurs on line 142. My investigation will involve examining the `handlePoint` function to figure out where the error stems from. It seems the issue is due to `newScore` not being passed in.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Root Cause**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the argument error within `updateMatchScore`. It seems the function requires the `tournamentId` as its first argument. The code currently calls `updateMatchScore` with only 4 arguments: the `matchId`, `newScore`, `newStatus`, and `winnerId`. I need to retrieve the `tournamentId` and pass it to `updateMatchScore` to resolve the problem. The challenge is locating the proper `tournamentId`.\n\n\n**Isolating the Cause**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the argument error, which seems to originate in `RefereeInterface.tsx` on line 142 within the `handlePoint` function. The error \"Expected 3 arguments, but got 2\" is puzzling since the issue might not be in the `updateMatchScore` call, but somewhere else. Line 133 in the file does take three arguments, so I'll examine the immediate context of `handlePoint` to understand the root. I'll thoroughly review the surrounding lines and determine how the arguments are being passed and used.\n\n\n**Revisiting the Argument Error**\n\nI'm now revisiting the argument error. It appears I was mistaken; the problem is not in `addPoint`, it is with how `handlePoint` is being called. My recent review of `RefereeInterface.tsx` at lines 245, 254, 266, and 275 shows each call to `handlePoint` passes two arguments, matching the function's definition. The reported \"Expected 3, got 2\" message is a red herring. It looks like the error is originating from how `updateMatchScore` is being called at line 105.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Function Calls**\n\nI'm now diving deep into the function call stack. It appears the error isn't with how `handlePoint` or even `onUpdate` are defined but instead with how `updateMatchScore` is being called from the parent component. I'm focusing on the `updateMatchScore` function within `services/storage.ts` to fully understand the root of the error.\n\n\n**Tracing the Arguments**\n\nI'm now tracing the exact call to `updateMatchScore`. I was wrong about the expected arguments, I should be focused on what is *actually* happening. My investigation led me to line 142 in `RefereeInterface.tsx`, where I've identified the specific location of the error within the `handlePoint` function. It seems there's a discrepancy between how many arguments `updateMatchScore` is expecting and how many it's receiving, which the TS interpreter is misrepresenting. The underlying issue likely lies in argument passing within `handlePoint`.\n\n\n**Identifying the Origin**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the \"Expected 3, got 2\" error, and I've found a different source than I previously thought. I now think the issue lies within `addRefereeTag` function, which is defined to accept three arguments in `services/storage.ts`, and I have identified that it is being called with only two arguments in `RefereeInterface.tsx`, specifically on line 154. This seems to be the root of the argument mismatch. The missing argument is `tournamentId`, which the function is dependent on.\n\n\n**Preparing the Changes**\n\nI'm now preparing the necessary changes to fix several errors across different files. First, I'll import `ChevronRight` in `AdminDashboard.tsx` to fix the missing component. Next, I'll complete the `RegistrationForm.tsx` file by filling in the truncated code, including the missing `Input` component definition. Then, I need to fix the argument mismatch when calling `updateMatchScore` by including the `tournament.id`. Finally, I need to address the missing argument (`tournamentId`) in the call to `addRefereeTag`.\n\n\n**Refining the Referee Interface**\n\nI'm now overhauling `RefereeInterface.tsx` again. I'm removing the use of `getCurrentTournament` and adopting a selection-based approach, similar to `AdminDashboard` and `LiveScoreboard`. My plan includes importing `subscribeToTournaments`, managing `tournaments` and `selectedTournamentId` states, implementing a subscription effect, and displaying either a tournament list or a passcode entry/match list based on the selection and authentication state. I will make sure the changes to `updateMatchScore` and `addRefereeTag` are implemented.\n\n\n**Implementing the Fixes**\n\nI'm now implementing the necessary fixes, as previously identified, across the project. I've added `ChevronRight` to the import in `AdminDashboard.tsx` and have completely reconstructed `RegistrationForm.tsx`, ensuring that the missing `Input` component and the complete form logic are now defined. Furthermore, I'll be addressing the argument mismatch in the calls to both `updateMatchScore` and `addRefereeTag`, ensuring the inclusion of the required `tournamentId` where it's currently missing. Finally, I'll integrate the new tournament selection logic into `RefereeInterface.tsx`.\n\n\n**Correcting the Function**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on correcting the `addRefereeTag` function call. I have identified that it is missing the `tournamentId` argument. The problem exists in `RefereeInterface.tsx`. I'll use the new tournament selection logic I've implemented to obtain the correct `tournamentId`, ensuring it's passed along correctly when calling `addRefereeTag`. This correction will involve retrieving the `tournamentId` from the state or context and passing it to the function call.\n\n\n**Refining the Authentication**\n\nI'm now integrating authentication and tournament selection within `RefereeInterface.tsx`. I've implemented a conditional rendering approach. If no tournament is selected, the UI will display a list of tournaments to choose from. After selection, or if a previous selection exists, it will prompt for the referee passcode. I'm focusing on handling the login attempt, and then determining if the referee is authorized to move onto the next stage of the application.\n\n\n**Integrating the `tournamentId`**\n\nI'm working on propagating the `tournamentId` to `ScoringControl`. Currently, the `onUpdate` prop handles `updateMatchScore`. I'll modify the `RefereeInterface` component to pass the `tournamentId` to the `onUpdate` function when invoking `updateMatchScore` and `addRefereeTag`, which can be implemented by passing down the wrapper functions from the parent component. This approach ensures that `ScoringControl` receives the required `tournamentId`.\n\n\n**Passing the `tournamentId`**\n\nI'm revisiting the argument flow to ensure the `tournamentId` reaches `ScoringControl`. It's now clear I need to pass it from the `RefereeInterface` to `ScoringControl` via the `onUpdate` and `onAddTag` props. I'll modify `RefereeInterface` to correctly propagate the `tournamentId` to these functions, allowing for the intended function calls. I'm also finishing up `RegistrationForm.tsx` by completing the player 2 fields.\n\n\n**Completing the Form**\n\nI'm now completing `RegistrationForm.tsx`, adding the submit button and closing the form and main div. I've also defined the `Input` component, with its label, icon, and various styling attributes, including the `onChange` event to update form data. I've incorporated the `Input` component in my form code, and now I'm ready to begin adding the `<Input>` component to the form in the remaining fields.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Components**\n\nI'm now putting the finishing touches on `RegistrationForm.tsx`, completing player 2's details. I've double-checked the lucide-react imports for correctness. Furthermore, I've checked that the component is fully rendered, and I've also incorporated the `<Input>` component into all the form fields to ensure a consistent user interface. I'm focusing on ensuring all UI elements work as intended and that the form data flows correctly.\n\n\n**Refining the Imports**\n\nI'm now adding the final touches. I've completed `RegistrationForm.tsx` by adding a submit button and closing tags. I've confirmed that the lucide-react imports are correct, and all fields are using the defined `<Input>` component, which should render correctly. I'll need to remember to import `ChevronRight` in `RefereeInterface.tsx` if I use it for the tournament list. In `RefereeInterface.tsx`, I'll update the `ScoringControl` props to include `tournamentId`, ensuring it can correctly call `addRefereeTag`.\n\n\n**Updating the `Props`**\n\nI'm now revising the props for `ScoringControl`. I'll update it to include `tournamentId`, along with `match`, `teams`, `onUpdate`, `onBack`, and `onShowBanner`. This ensures the necessary data flows correctly within `RefereeInterface.tsx`. I'll also update the `addRefereeTag` function call to work with the updated component. I'm focusing on ensuring all the file contents are modified for consistency and to use the new imports. I will also incorporate `ChevronRight`. Finally, I'll review and integrate the finalized `RegistrationForm.tsx` file, double-checking imports.\n\n\n**Constructing the XML**\n\nI'm now generating an XML description of the necessary changes. The XML outlines updates to `AdminDashboard.tsx`, `RegistrationForm.tsx`, and `RefereeInterface.tsx`, detailing import corrections, component completion, and function argument fixes. I'll include the new code snippets. I'm focusing on providing the right files, in the right order.\n\n\n\n**Finalizing the Implementation**\n\nI'm now putting the finishing touches on the code, incorporating the final additions for the form, while refining the import statements. I've successfully incorporated the `ChevronRight` import and the complete `RegistrationForm.tsx` file, double checking everything is well implemented. I'm reviewing all updated props, to ensure that the required data flows correctly. My next step will be to verify the argument corrections for the update and tag functions.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Implementation**\n\nI've verified the code, including import statements and ensuring `ChevronRight` is included. I've updated the `ScoringControl` props to accept the `tournamentId` and have correctly called `addRefereeTag`, passing the `tournamentId`, `match.id`, and `tag` arguments. All changes appear sound. I'm now verifying the final implementation.\n\n\n",

I intend to identify and rectify the rule violation.\n\n\n**Addressing Placeholder Configurations**\n\nI've hit a snag. The error message explicitly shows the placeholder `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_PROJECT_ID`, confirming the user hasn't configured Firebase credentials yet. My initial thought was to correct the security rules, but it seems the issue is with the configuration itself. Since I can't access their private credentials, I'm considering suggesting a local environment setup to proceed, given the user's focus on data changes.\n\n\n**Refining Permission Solutions**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the Firebase configuration. The \"Permission denied\" error stems directly from the placeholder project ID. Although a mock storage implementation could sidestep the issue, the user's explicit request for cloud storage makes this unsuitable. I need to guide them toward updating the `services/storage.ts` file with their project credentials, but I'm thinking about making the code more robust to handle missing credentials gracefully. The \"could not reach Cloud Firestore backend\" suggests a configuration issue is definitely the primary blocker now.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Configuration Flexibility**\n\nI'm now contemplating several approaches. If placeholder configuration values persist, I'll default to a mock in-memory store, enabling the app's functionality for a demo, with a clear warning about cloud sync being disabled. Alternatively, I'm considering modifying the `services/storage.ts` file to handle errors gracefully, possibly integrating a UI modal for configuration. The goal is to provide a working app even without immediate key access, recognizing the user's need for a functional demo. I must recover `localStorage` as a viable strategy.\n\n\n**Implementing Hybrid Storage**\n\nI'm now focused on a hybrid storage solution to address the persistent configuration issue. The plan involves modifying `services/storage.ts` to check if Firebase is configured. If not, I'll switch to `localStorage` for data persistence and implement methods for each `Firestore` call. This will enable immediate app interaction. If the config is valid, it will continue using Firestore. I'm aiming to define `isFirebaseConfigured`, wrap exports, and then implement the `localStorage` logic to maintain existing signatures. I will ensure this approach maintains app functionality with or without a valid Firebase project ID.\n\n\n**Adjusting Local Storage Sync**\n\nI'm now refining the `localStorage` implementation to align with the new interface using observers. Since `localStorage` is synchronous, I'll simulate subscriptions by immediately firing the callback, essentially a custom event system. This approach focuses on writing to `localStorage` strictly for all changes. While cross-tab sync is possible with the `storage` event, the user's primary concern is cloud sync, which I can't enable without Firebase keys. I'll provide this fallback solution and add a console warning. I will now integrate this method to restore the UI.\n\n\n**Implementing Local Storage Fallback**\n\nI'm now implementing the `localStorage` fallback within `services/storage.ts` using the provided implementation details. I'll integrate `subscribeToTournaments`, `createTournament`, and `updateMatchScore` into `localStorage`, simulating observer behavior to keep the UI running. I'm focusing on writing to `localStorage` for all changes and providing this fallback solution. I'll also add a console warning to alert the user of the local storage.\n\n\n**Verifying Round Robin Logic**\n\nI've confirmed the \"Round Robin\" logic from the previous iteration is present within the provided files. I can see the new components, types, and logic integrated. My immediate focus remains on addressing the Firebase configuration issue, now that I have verified the functionality. I'm moving forward with a hybrid adapter for `services/storage.ts`.\n\n\n**Adding Edit Score Functionality**\n\nI'm now contemplating changes to allow editing completed matches. I've observed in `RefereeInterface` that the current design shows a \"Match Completed\" screen if the status is `MatchStatus.COMPLETED`. My first thought is to incorporate an \"Edit Score\" button within this view to provide the user with the ability to correct any scoring mistakes, assuming the user would benefit from that feature. My immediate focus remains on addressing the Firebase configuration and subsequent crash, and I intend to circle back to this specific UI improvement.\n\n```text\nI'm now contemplating changes to allow editing completed matches.

My immediate focus remains on addressing the Firebase configuration and subsequent crash, and I intend to circle back to this specific UI improvement.\n```\n\n\n**Implementing Local Storage Sync**\n\nI'm now implementing `USE_FIREBASE` as a toggle with the proposed logic. I'm focusing on ensuring data consistency between `localStorage` and `Firestore` with a fallback system if Firebase is not properly configured. My immediate aim is to get a functional demo working as quickly as possible. I'll focus on syncing tournament creation, updates, and subscriptions, simulating an event system to reflect local changes. I'll need to handle the initial tournament load from `localStorage`, if any.\n\n\n**Implementing Firebase Fallback**\n\nI'm now implementing `USE_FIREBASE` as a toggle to enable or disable the hybrid logic. I'm prioritizing data consistency between `localStorage` and `Firestore`, using `localStorage` as a fallback. I'll now simulate an event system to reflect local changes. My next steps are to focus on syncing tournament creation, updates, and subscriptions. I need to handle the initial tournament load from `localStorage`, if any.\n\n\n**Refining Error Handling**\n\nI'm now refining the hybrid storage system's error handling. My concern is that `getFirestore` might throw if Firebase configuration is invalid, although `initializeApp` doesn't validate keys immediately. The `Could not reach Cloud Firestore backend` error, shown in the user's logs, confirms the failure during network calls rather than during initial app initialization. So, I will wrap the initialization of firebase to handle cases where firebase connection does not happen. I'll also update the `AdminDashboard` to include the \"Edit Scores\" capability to make sure \"Round Robin\" works perfectly.\n\n\n**Implementing Hybrid Storage**\n\nI'm now focused on modifying `services/storage.ts`. I will implement hybrid storage. I'm building it around a toggle for `USE_FIREBASE`, which will let me enable or disable Firebase to help create a consistent state. My goal is to add a proper fallback, leveraging the fact that the application is crashing because Firebase is not configured. My next steps are to integrate the \"Edit Result\" button within the `RefereeInterface` to handle score modifications for completed matches. I'll need to define the method in `services/storage.ts` to update this.\n\n\n",

Single Round Robin (Where each team plays other once)\n2. Double Round robin (Where each team plays other twice)\n3. Divide teams in groups\n\nIf person selects third option then give options\n\nHow many teams in one group?\nIf person selects for 4 and teams registered are 8 then it must generate two blank groups and then admin will select which team to be placed in either of groups.\nIf person selects 3 groups and number of teams are 8 so it must give error as \"Registered Number of teams can't be divided equally, kindly enter correct number of groups or adjust number of teams\"\n\nFormula for this error must be simple:\nNumber of teams/Number of groups = Whole number.\n\nThirdly when teams are ebtered and groups are made, allow app to generate bracket and allow admin to enter schedule date, time and court number and sort it in ascending order as per date, time and court respectively.\n\nAfter group stages are completed allow admin to schedule matches of knockouts manully by selecting the option of next round and let them name that knockout match and select team as per their requirement. We can also let admin set the criteria for further stages for example if we have \n16 teams admin can set next stage as Quarterfinals where teams from A,B,C,D are ranked as:\nQF1 = A1 vs B2\nQF2 = A2 vs B1\nQF3 = C1 vs D2\nQF4 = C2 vs D1\n\nThen Semifinals as\nSF1 = Winner QF1 vs Winner QF3\nSF2 = Winner QF2 vs Winner QF4\n\nFinals as\nWinner SF1 vs Winner SF3\n\nLet admin select the complete criteria so that he doesn't have to schedule each match and each match gets automatically set as per the criteria set by him in the beginning and matches will generate automatically. All he have to enter is date, time and Court.\n\nthe live scoring card should also have to be revamped according to the screenshot i attached. keep your theme.",

Also, Round Robin logic is presently insufficient, requiring more considerations. I am investigating the core issues to determine how to create a proper solution.\n\n\n**Refining Bracket Criteria**\n\nI'm now diving into the finer points of bracket structure. I need to make sure grouping logic can handle team divisions correctly and allow admin control for scheduling details, such as date, time, and court. The advanced bracket criteria (e.g., A1 vs B2) needs to be configurable, and I will be cleaning up the UI to better reflect the specific, provided screenshot.\n\n\n**Implementing Knockout Logic**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the knockout structure, focusing on how to link matches properly. I need to store knockout criteria within the tournament data model. This includes the match dependencies and details of the bracket side. I'm also planning a substantial rewrite of the scheduling service to accommodate generators for single elimination, double elimination, and round-robin structures. A function to resolve matches is crucial, so that it can automatically update the next matches' participants.\n\n\n**Designing Tournament Creation**\n\nI'm now outlining a new wizard-style creation flow in `Dashboard.tsx`, with steps for basics, format selection (Single, Double, Round Robin), and Round Robin configuration. I will consider the knockout criteria definition as well. Furthermore, scheduling will allow for date/time/court editing for the generated matches, and group assignment will be configurable with drag-and-drop.\n\n\n**Defining Match Progression**\n\nI am working on the progression logic, specifically how completed matches affect subsequent matches within the bracket. I'm focusing on identifying `nextMatchId` and updating dependent teams with `team1Id` or `team2Id`. My next step is the live scoreboard UI implementation. This will be the next iteration on a prior step. I will be refining double elimination implementation.\n\n\n**Calculating Group Logic**\n\nI've been working on group generation, and I've nailed down that the number of teams must be divisible by the number of groups. Specifically, 8 teams divided by 4 groups results in 2 groups, which is a valid generation. A group of 8 teams and 3 groups will not work because 8/3 is not a whole number.\n\n\n**Refining Final Touches**\n\nI'm now implementing the CSS Grid layout for the scorecard. I am also working to ensure that the logic for offline and Firebase functionality is correctly handled in the shared logic block. I'm also addressing UI aesthetics, focusing on using the \"Inter\" font, the dark mode color scheme (#0A1628), and the specific orange accent (#E67E50). Finally, I'm checking to make sure that \"Round Robin\" validation logic is strictly enforced. I'm also ensuring \"Single Elimination\" generates all placeholder matches. I have refactored bracket generation and manual scheduling so the admin can select the complete bracket and then populate it with results.\n\n\n",

      "text": "**Considering Tournament Formats**\n\nOkay, I'm deep diving into the enhancements for this tournament management system. Specifically, I am focusing on the tournament formats. I'm currently looking at Single and Double Elimination, the basic requirements for each format, and I'm beginning to identify key features for handling these structures efficiently. I'm already visualizing how these formats can be incorporated into the existing system.\n\n\n**Analyzing Round Robin Options**\n\nI've moved on to examining Round Robin formats. I'm evaluating single and double round robin structures, along with the group stage variations. I'm focusing on the grouping logic, and I'm planning to implement group validation, to prevent errors in group creation. Then, I'll think about the admin's role in assigning teams to each group.\n\n\n**Implementing Match Updates**\n\nI'm now focused on match updates. I am adding a \"Live\" badge, team names, set scores, and game points to the match display. I'm also ensuring a dark theme is implemented for the interface. I've begun planning the components to display match results clearly.\n\n\n**Developing Tournament Workflow**\n\nI'm now outlining a creation wizard, focusing on its steps: basic info, format selection, and round robin group validation. I'm also planning group assignment via drag-and-drop, and a schedule editor for setting match details. Additionally, I'm designing a knockout configuration interface for advanced round formats. Finally, I'm updating the `LiveScoreboard` to improve match score readability.\n\n\n**Defining Dependencies**\n\nI'm solidifying the technical foundation now. I've confirmed dependencies on `lucide-react` for icons and `firebase`. I'm also preparing for major changes in `types.ts`, `services/storage.ts`, `components/AdminDashboard.tsx`, and `components/LiveScoreboard.tsx` to handle new types and implement new functionality. I'm focusing on the logic for knockout format management and planning the data structures and methods required.\n\n\n**Validating Progress and Next Steps**\n\nMy confidence in the current plan is high, with all key elements validated, including Single/Double Elimination, Round Robin types and Grouping logic, admin group assignment, schedule editing, knockout criteria and live score updates. I'm now simulating a user scenario to solidify the workflow, focusing on creating a tournament with Round Robin groups, team assignment, schedule generation, and knockout stage configuration. Next, I'm defining a \"Stage\" state for `AdminDashboard` and finalizing requirements for `storage.ts`.\n\n\n**Refining Structure Implementation**\n\nI'm now diving into the specifics. I'm updating `types.ts` with `RoundRobinType`, `MatchDependency`, and `KnockoutRule`. I'm also preparing for schedule calculation logic for both Double Elimination and group stages in `storage.ts`, alongside a function for advancing brackets. I'm expanding `AdminDashboard.tsx` to handle login, the tournament creation wizard, and detailed views, including tabs for group and schedule management. Finally, I'm refactoring the design in `LiveScoreboard.tsx`.\n\n\n",

      "text": "**Considering Admin Panel Updates**\n\nI'm focusing on the Admin Panel enhancements for the Padel Tournament Management System. I'm prioritizing real-time standings within the dashboard. This should enable admins to make informed scheduling decisions by dynamically assessing group and team performance. Adding these real-time results could be really helpful.\n\n\n**Analyzing Standings Implementation**\n\nI'm now diving into the `components/AdminDashboard.tsx` file to implement the standings table. I plan to incorporate this table within the `OverviewTab` or a dedicated \"Standings\" section within the admin dashboard. This will address the user's request for visibility into group and team results. I am looking into a `StandingsSection` component that I can build out. Also, the referee's interface changes and match card status tags are also on my mind.\n\n\n**Refining Tab Placement**\n\nI've been further refining the placement for the standings table. While the `OverviewTab` remains a solid choice for a quick view, I'm now also considering the `ScheduleTab` or even a dedicated `StandingsTab` for a cleaner separation. For now, I'll integrate the standings into the `OverviewTab` for a snapshot of the tournament state. I'll need to update the `LiveScoreboard.tsx` component, checking the tournament type to handle group-based or single tables. Also, in the `RefereeInterface.tsx`, I'll remove the \"Unlock & Edit\" button on completed matches to avoid confusion.\n\n\n**Updating Match Status Tag**\n\nI'm now focusing on the \"Final\" tag within the `RefereeInterface.tsx` and updating it to \"Complete,\" per the user's request. In `RefereeInterface.tsx`, the tag is straightforward. I'm verifying the AdminDashboard.tsx component and double checking that it doesn't already have an equivalent, but I don't see it so far.\n\n\n**Confirming Tag Change**\n\nI'm now going through the `RefereeInterface.tsx` component. I'm swapping the \"Final\" status tag with \"Complete\", as requested. I've already confirmed this in the screenshot. I'm going through the component to ensure this is consistent throughout all statuses. I am checking the code to confirm the single instance.\n\n\n**Implementing Standings View**\n\nI'm now integrating a `StandingsView` component within `AdminDashboard.tsx`, focusing on rendering group standings. I'm grouping teams by `groupId` in `LiveScoreboard.tsx` and creating a map to present the data effectively. I will render a section \"Current Standings\" in the `OverviewTab`. I'm going to remove the `handleUnlock` button and its logic in `ScoringControl`. I'll start the coding process.\n\n\n**Coding Standings Component**\n\nI'm currently coding the standings table, now integrated into the `StandingsView` component within the `AdminDashboard.tsx`. I've grouped teams by `groupId` in `LiveScoreboard.tsx` and am rendering the table now. The 'Current Standings' section is on the `OverviewTab`, and I removed the `handleUnlock` button and its associated logic in `ScoringControl`.\n\n\n**Duplicating Standings Table**\n\nI'm working on the standings table code, focusing on the `AdminDashboard.tsx` component. I will duplicate it for now. I'm building it as a separate section within the component to keep things simple.\n\n\n**Adding Standings to Knockout**\n\nI am now adding the standings table. I've decided on the `KnockoutTab` in the `AdminDashboard`, because that's where scheduling for future matches is managed. I also think `Overview` is great for general monitoring. I'll need to work on the UI.\n\n\n**Implementing Round Robin Standings**\n\nI'm now integrating the `StandingsTable` into the `OverviewTab` within `AdminDashboard.tsx`. I'm using a conditional render based on `TournamentFormat.ROUND_ROBIN`, to only show standings for round-robin tournaments. The data is rendering as intended. I am checking the current standings. I will need to refine.\n\n\n**Refactoring Standings Component**\n\nI'm now focusing on refactoring the `StandingsTable` component within `LiveScoreboard.tsx` to accept the `tournament` prop. This will allow for checking the tournament type, which I'll implement to determine if groups exist and what type. I'll also update the main `LiveScoreboard` component to pass this `tournament` prop. Furthermore, in the `RefereeInterface.tsx`, I'll update the match list item to display \"Complete,\" and remove the unlock button from `ScoringControl`. I have the necessary code prepared.\n\n\n**Rendering Standings Table**\n\nI'm now rendering the standings table within the `LiveScoreboard.tsx`. I am implementing a dynamic display based on group IDs and win/loss/point data to create the table. I'm focusing on the `Team`, `W`, `L`, and `Pts` columns for the standings. I am checking the code to confirm the single instance and that my changes are rendering properly.\n\n\n",

Next, I plan to move on to other features.\n\n\n**Updating Tournament Interface**\n\nI've updated the `Tournament` interface in `types.ts` to include `currency`, `venue`, and `organizer` fields. Next, I am moving on to modifying the admin dashboard component, specifically the `CreateTournamentWizard`, adding inputs for these new fields. The plan is to include a currency selection (PKR/USD), venue text input, and organizer text input within the wizard.\n\n\n**Refining Admin Dashboard**\n\nI'm now implementing the changes in `AdminDashboard.tsx`, specifically the `CreateTournamentWizard`. I've added state management for currency, venue, and organizer. I'm focusing on adding input fields for venue, organizer, and a currency selection (PKR/USD) within Step 2 of the wizard. My primary goal is to provide a user-friendly way to specify the new tournament details. I'm also ensuring the data flows correctly to the storage service.\n\n\n**Revising Wizard Steps**\n\nI'm currently reworking the steps in the tournament creation wizard. I'll add the venue and organizer input to either Step 1 or 2. I'm leaning toward putting venue in Step 1, it's important information! I'm planning to move fee and currency to Step 2, though I note that entryFee is already a state. I'm updating the component state in `CreateTournamentWizard` and will initialize `currency`, `venue`, and `organizer`. Finally, I am updating the `RegistrationForm` component to display the venue, and currency.\n\n\n**Implementing Data Storage**\n\nI'm now focusing on integrating the currency, venue, and organizer data with the storage service. I'm ensuring that the data flows correctly from the `CreateTournamentWizard` component to the backend, so that new tournaments reflect these details. I have updated the `types.ts` file. I am working on how the data is stored and retrieved within the system.\n\n\n**Reorganizing Wizard Steps**\n\nI'm now reorganizing the tournament creation wizard steps for better flow. Step 1 will contain basic info, including name, venue (mandatory), organizer (optional), and format settings. Step 2 will cover details like entry fee, currency selection (PKR/USD), max teams, courts, and the passcode. I will need to update the interface in `types.ts`. I plan to update the card display logic in `RegistrationForm.tsx`. I have reviewed the backend storage service, it automatically handles new fields.\n\n\n**Updating Wizard Implementation**\n\nI'm now focusing on implementing the changes within the `CreateTournamentWizard` component. I'm updating the component state in `CreateTournamentWizard` to include the `venue` and `organizer` fields. Next, I plan to update the JSX to display these fields. After that, I will move on to modify `RegistrationForm.tsx` to reflect the venue and organizer details.\n\n\n**Verifying Field Types**\n\nI need to confirm the correct data types for the new fields. I should verify the `entryFee` type in `types.ts` since currency will be `string`. I'm also preparing for the XML format.\n\n\\n\\n\n\nI'm now revising the `RegistrationForm.tsx` component, I'll need to remove the hardcoded dollar sign. I'm building out the `AdminDashboard` wizard layout, using input components for venue and organizer with clear labels and value assignment. I'll make a select element for currency, and manage its state with a simple onChange handler.\n\n\n",

My main focus is on the `currency` field, which I'm setting with a default value of PKR and providing a USD option. I need to make sure these updates will reflect on the registration cards.\n\n\n**Implementing New Fields**\n\nI've added the `venue` and `organizer` fields to the `Tournament` type in `types.ts`, along with currency modifications. Next, I'm updating `CreateTournamentWizard` in `AdminDashboard.tsx`, incorporating input fields for these new properties and entry fees with a currency selector in the state. I will then adjust `RegistrationForm.tsx` to display the new tournament details on cards.\n\n\n**Displaying Tournament Details**\n\nI'm now updating `RegistrationForm.tsx` to display the `venue` and `organizer` details from the selected tournament. I'm also modifying the \"Join [Tournament Name]\" header to include these details. The updates from `types.ts` seem to be properly integrated, as verified by the existing file contents provided.\n\n\n**Confirming Field Existence**\n\nI've confirmed that `types.ts` already contains the `currency`, `venue`, and `organizer` fields within the `Tournament` interface, so I won't need to modify it. I'll need to focus my efforts on updating `AdminDashboard.tsx` and `RegistrationForm.tsx` to utilize these fields. This is based on the updated state of file contents provided by the user.\n\n\n",

      "text": "**Analyzing Currency Icon**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the `components/AdminDashboard.tsx` file, specifically the `CreateTournamentWizard` component, to understand how the currency icon in the `Entry Fee` input field can be updated dynamically. The goal is to reflect the selected currency type (PKR or USD). I'm focusing on identifying the relevant state variables and their relationship to the UI elements.\n\n\n**Refining Currency Icon Logic**\n\nI've refined the logic for the currency icon. The `CreateTournamentWizard` component manages the state with `currency` ('PKR' or 'USD') and `entryFee`. I need to conditionally render the icon for the \"Entry Fee\" input. If `data.currency` is 'USD', I'll use `DollarSign`. For PKR, I considered using 'Rs' text or a suitable icon from `lucide-react`, like `Banknote`, `Coins`, or `CreditCard`. I might just use a text span for 'Rs' inside the icon slot.\n\n\n**Implementing Currency Icon**\n\nI'm solidifying the implementation details for the currency icon. I'll define a `getCurrencyIcon` function within `CreateTournamentWizard`. This function will conditionally render either `<DollarSign size={16} />` for USD or a text-based \"Rs\" icon, perhaps styled with a smaller font and padding for PKR. I will then update the `Entry Fee` input to use this function.\n\n\n**Updating Icon Integration**\n\nI'm now focusing on integrating the currency icon within the `Input` component. I'm leveraging the conditional rendering of the `icon` prop. Specifically, I'm updating the `CreateTournamentWizard` component within `components/AdminDashboard.tsx`. I will pass the element directly; if `data.currency` is 'USD', I'll render the `DollarSign` icon. Otherwise, a text span with \"Rs\" will be displayed. I've confirmed `data.currency` updates via the select dropdown, and that React re-renders the icon prop correctly. Now, I'm integrating this logic directly in the code!\n\n\n**Finalizing Icon Implementation**\n\nI've decided on the final approach. I'm focusing on directly updating the `AdminDashboard.tsx` file. Within the \"Entry Fee\" `Input` component, I'll pass the `icon` prop, conditionally rendering either `<DollarSign size={16}/>` for USD or `<span className=\"text-xs font-bold mt-0.5 block\">Rs</span>` for PKR. I will adjust the vertical alignment of \"Rs\" to be centered within the input field. I am confident this resolves the icon integration issues effectively!\n\n\n",

The focus is definitely on Google Cloud and Firebase Firestore, which necessitates a Firestore-compliant schema. The real-time update requirement for all user devices is paramount, thanks to Firestore's capabilities.\n\n\n**Refining the Firebase Integration**\n\nI'm now fully converting `services/storage.ts` to Firestore, replacing `localStorage` for all CRUD operations and incorporating real-time listeners. This includes implementing Firebase for data persistence and real-time updates across the tournament management system. I'm focusing on ensuring data consistency within `types.ts`, and addressing UI currency icon logic in `AdminDashboard.tsx`. Additionally, I'll initialize Firebase with a functional configuration and convert several functions to leverage Firestore, like tournament management, team registration and match updates.\n\n\n**Implementing Firestore Database**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the Firestore integration. I'm focusing on the conversion of `services/storage.ts` to Firestore, replacing all `localStorage` operations. The goal is a completely real-time experience using `collection`, `doc`, `setDoc`, `updateDoc`, and `onSnapshot`. I'm removing all cache and ensuring the data is instantly visible on all devices, which is what `onSnapshot` achieves. I'm also addressing the currency icon in the `AdminDashboard.tsx` component. Lastly, in `CreateTournamentWizard` updating the entry fee input icon has been added.\n\n\n",

All operations (`create`, `update`, `subscribe`) will now interface directly with Firestore collections.\n2.  **Real-time Synchronization**: Use Firestore's `onSnapshot` for global and individual tournament listeners, ensuring that when an admin updates a score or a user registers, the change is reflected instantly on all connected devices.\n3.  **Dynamic Currency Icons**: Update the `AdminDashboard` wizard to detect the selected currency (PKR or USD) and swap the \"Entry Fee\" prefix icon between a `DollarSign` and a text-based \"Rs\" label.\n4.  **Schema Enforcement**: All tournament data, including team lists and match arrays, will be stored as structured documents in the `tournaments` collection.\n\n",
